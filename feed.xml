<title>Just Use a Database</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I am in the middle of writing some scripts to migrate a bunch of data stored as JSON into a SQLite database as well as a small front-end application for visualizations and CRUD-style operations on that data.</p>

<p>I started with JSON because we wanted to get moving quickly, and with JSON we could be hand-generating and -correcting data records while we waited for better tools to get developed. My partner on the project is also less technical, and the idea was that a human-readable format would be more likely to make him available for data entry while we waited for me to build better tools (or if those tools never came.)</p>

<p>I also thought it would be a good idea to always have our data in a plain text format so that it could be easily archived and shared regardless of the technological state the project was left in. The worry was with an ambitious, but unfunded, side project we would potentially hit a wall at some point, and I did not want to be left with a bunch of work to do to then expose our data to be reusable by someone else.</p>

<p>That was a mistake.</p>

<p>Working around the constraints involved in keeping our data in this way has almost certainly added up to more work than was theoretically saved by not building the tools to work with a database. And now I’m building those tools anyways. And in the event that we do stop working on the project, the work involved in coming up with a schema for a set of JSON (or similar) files and the output scripts to generate them would not be so big a deal.</p>

<p>I’ve learned the lesson again: just use a relational database.</p>

<title>Escaping on an iPad with no Esc key</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I’ve recently been connecting to a DigitalOcean droplet with the mosh shell using the <a href="https://www.blink.sh">Blink</a> app on my iPad. It’s been a fun way to do some light web development work away from my desk at home without having to lug a lot of gear.</p>

<p>I’m using Apple’s smart folio keyboard for the time-being. It does not have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> key.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten around a lot of my <code class="highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> key muscle memory already (I end up in all caps by accident a lot because <code class="highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> is mapped to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Caps Lock</code> on my Mac), but I found myself in vim on the server this morning and realized I had no idea how to leave insert mode without an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> key.</p>

<p>Turns out <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">[</code> sends the same ASCII code that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> does. Now I know.</p>

      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0307953890/ref=nosim/latin031-20">Jay Caspian Kang. <i>The Dead Do Not Improve</i>. New York: Hogarth, 2012.</a>
      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I have a particular affinity for California outsider detective characters, so even when I thought that was all that was going on here, I was excited for it. I like Kang’s cynical sense of humor, and we’re of similar ages, tastes, and worldviews as far as I can tell from what I’ve seen of him in media (the book’s title is a Silver Jews reference, after all). I was pleasantly surprised that there is more here than just the detective story. The critiques of Bay Area- and Silicon Valley-facilitated celebrity and attention culture and limp liberalism that today may feel a little obvious were prescient, but no less true, when the book came out. Conversely, the concern with mass violence is very much of its era, but unfortunately no less important today. The book is simultaneously a page-turner and a little bit grotesque, which is an unusual combination.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I took a very long time to get through this. I probably should have dropped it as it never turned the corner for me, but the premise kept me waiting to be hooked by it. The setting is a town where the study of history and contact with the outside world are prohibited. I kept waiting for more interesting consequences of this tension to be born out and for the cast of strange characters reminiscent of an English countryside mystery to yield more interest, but the resolution comes instead through magical and fantastical conflict that is simply not my taste. I confess it may have been a mistake that I listened to it as an audiobook instead of reading it. It’s possible that some of the detail I was hoping for would have been apparent if I had had time to sit with it and tease it out, rather than being pulled along at the narrator’s pace.</p>

<title>Recent Reading: Cartels, Baking, and Kleptocracy</title>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I appreciate Michael Lewis’s Trump-era focus on the centrality of bureaucratic competence (or lack thereof) to American successes and the unfortunate lack of public awareness of its dysfunction in the shadow of the Trump administrations more sensational failures, embarrassments, and abuses. The primary focus here has the particularly Trumpian theme of kleptocracy at the National Weather Service. It’s material that has now been made available elsewhere, but in this iteration was produced as an Audible-exclusive audiobook. Lewis reads his own work, and his natural storyteller’s gift comes through as well in his voice and delivery as it does in his writing.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This e-book is a good, pragmatic walkthrough for building a web app with React, Node.js, and GraphQL. The focus is on React, and the pacing is the best in the sections most-focused on React. To the (limited) extent that there is some more theoretical material explaining the practical examples, this is similarly the most useful in the React sections. Working with this book has been a worthwhile exercise, but the most instructional value here is definitely dedicated to React and the sections on the rest of the stack will probably need to be supplemented from elsewhere</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Andersson is a Swedish food journalist who seems to focus on practical home baker oriented recipes. This English translation of her book is very direct in that there are quantities that appear in pretty unusual quantities in terms of imperial measurements. I might have preferred to have the original metric measurements so that I could do conversions myself or not as convenient. The recipes themselves, though, are very useful. Lots of Swedish basics I will enjoy experimenting with and some good practical advice on how to adjust basic recipes to personal tastes. In my experience, baking books either pursue a theoretical that is only useful for relatively advanced bakers or present basic recipes with no elaboration on how they work and how they might be altered. Andersson’s more open approach to instruction at a technical level appropriate to baking simple family-oriented basics has been very useful to me.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>We received this book as a Christmas gift from a friend who confessed it had wrecked his winter grading schedule. It works on an impressive scale, exploring the fallout of the U.S. war on drugs in Mexico over the course of about 15 years and from Guatemala to Matamoros to San Diego, but with the heart of its narrative in Juaréz at the peak of the violence there. It’s both engrossing and appalling in its action sequences while managing to be mostly sensitive to the horrible human consequences of U.S.-driven anti-drug policy. It is fundamentally an entertainment, but its political engagement feels authentic.</p>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I’ve set up a new small web page I’m calling <a href="https://oddments.brianjon.es">Oddments</a> to collect links to and information about projects I’m working on.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that having a place to collect these things will provide some motivation to keep building them.</p>

<p>I keep bouncing back and forth on the value of having hobbies and pursuits that generate ephemeral products. On the one hand it is the case that the pressure to conceive of any freetime pursuit as something to be connected to a larger project or to be productized or otherwise commodified is a powerful trap. On the other, my life at the moment makes for such infrequent moments of freedom to play that having leisure pursuits that produce lasting products is a nice reminder that I do in fact have hobbies.</p>

<p>So here is <a href="https://oddments.brianjone.s">Oddments</a>. Let’s hope it keeps growing.</p>

      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B078W646XC/ref=nosim/latin031-20">Kate Atkinson, <i>Transcription</i>, New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2018.</a>
      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p><em>Transcription</em> is an interesting sort of spy novel which operates in several different historical contexts. The protagonist works surveillance for a sting operation on Nazi sympathizers in wartime London. Her wartime experiences and relationships reappear as obligations in her post-war life working in children’s radio programming for the BBC. She returns to London late in life from a long life spent abroad. In each of these chronological frames there are connections and tensions implied, but things don’t come together until the end in a satisfying revelation.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I found this synthesis of the contemporary science on human endurance fascinating. The author is a runner and much of the subject matter has to do with running, but it is more than a book about running. The chapters are arranged thematically—collected around subjects such as diet, cardiovascular fitness, pain, and mental stamina—but a constant is the importance of person’s frame of mind and perception of their situation on their capacity for endurance. I found the material interesting in its own right, but I’m also curious about the potential to apply some of the insights about frame of mind to my own running.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I grabbed <em>The Feral Detective</em> in a rush at the airport in Houston over Christmas, knowing nothing about it and spending way more money than I intended for a new release hardcover. I loved it. In its own peculiar way, it fits into the long legacy of the outsider L.A. detective. It is alternatingly funny and shocking and harrowing. Its relationship to the geography of the Mojave Desert and the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains feels very real. It is the first work of fiction I personally have encountered composed of and for the moment of the Trump presidency, and in my opinion it earns its opportunity to represent this cultural moment. I strongly recommend it.</p>

<title>Mortadella Dürüm and Authenticity</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/dining/momofuku-bang-bar-review.html">Pete Wells’s review</a> of David Chang’s Bang Bar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it’s been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar’s cooks — this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview — for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fried-baloney-sandwich-as-mortadella-dürüm sounds amazing and is precisely the kind of thinking high-low, free-associating that makes me to ready to buy pretty much anything David Chang is selling. It’s also a poignant illustration of the possibilities opened by leaving the authenticity trap experienced by so many non-white restaurant owners in the U.S., as <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap">argued recently</a> by Sarah Kay.</p>

<title>Launching Local Memory</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>This morning I finally made the first public link to a project I’ve been working on for two years. It’s finished; Michael and I will continue adding new content and new features, but it is now complete enough to share publicly.</p>

<p><a href="https://local-memory.org">Local Memory: A History of Music in Austin</a> is a public history project we’re presenting as a website. Our first exhibit, <a href="https://local-memory.org/athens-on-the-colorado">Athens on the Colorado</a>, explores the dominance of the university campuses and communities in defining most audiences’ encounter with music performance in the 1930s and 1940s in Austin. This exhibit will continue to expand, and we have started working on our next exhibit as well.</p>

<p>The project also presents a database of performances, artists, and venues. So far, the bulk of the effort around this material has focused on making internal tools to digest and clean up the data. We still have a lot more data to process and pull into the site, but we have enough of a foundation (a little over 2000 performances) to start working with more interesting ways of exploring and presenting the data as well.</p>

<p>On the technical side, I’ve built the site using <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, the React-based static-site builder. It has been a good way to force myself to learn React (and get increasingly comfortable with the modern JavaScript syntax toolchain in general), and I anticipate writing up some of the things I’ve worked on in connection to that as well.</p>

<p>Mostly it feels good to finally be able to give a little oxygen to this project that has been under wraps for so long. It’s exciting to think that now work done on new features will have a much shorter path to entering the wild. (It’s also exciting to see the new time for other personal projects opening in the near future.)</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The bones of this book suggest a pretty straight-forward thriller set largely in a night market in Taipei. The suspense works, and the characters mostly have a couple of individual elements layered on their trope-y roles. The thing that sets it apart is greater-than-usual attention to detail in setting the scene around plot. I found the detail about the Taiwanese setting  interesting, and it was informative for me as someone who knows little about the place. I sometimes found myself wishing that the novel’s ambitions were set a bit higher to make more use of the texture available to it from this scene-setting work, but this was nonetheless an enjoyable and worthwhile leisure read.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I’ve meant to read <em>Isaac’s Storm</em> forever. Galveston is one of my favorite places, and it had become a source of at least a little embarrassment that there existed this incredibly widely-read book by an incredibly successful non-fiction author that I had not read. When my friend recently recommended it again, I decided to read it. Since the book was first published, some of the meteorological history and climatology has become of more ‘professional’ interest to me as my dissertation wandered adjacent to climate science history. There is a strong sense of place evoked; the Galveston presented here is familiar. I am an atypical reader in having strong personal interests in both the Galveston history and the meteorological history, but in that context, the litany of anecdotes of individual tragedies during the storm wore on my patience more than anything else. I understand that others would not be likely to have the same reaction.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I have started to practice my Dutch by checking strips out from the library in Gent. This is the first I’ve had a chance to finish. This volume is the fourth in the series, so it took me a while to get my bearings. I would like to return to the beginning if I can find the first volume. Isaac “the pirate” is a French painter who falls in with a group of pirates on his travels to the New World. This installment covers his return to Paris to find the world of artists he left dissolved and his father ill. One of his pirate friends has accompanied them, and they get caught up in the Parisian underworld. It is not the adventure story that the setting and synopsis might suggest; it is more of a character study. I’m curious to see if this represents an evolution of the series as it returns to France or if this was the dynamic from the beginning.</p>

<title>Tuning Memory for a Self-Hosted Mastodon Instance</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I recently started hosting my own <a href="https://masto.brianjon.es/@brian">Mastodon instance</a>, but was having a difficult time getting it to run on the low-end Droplet configuration at DigitalOcean. I was happy to run this experiment at $5/mo, but $10/mo was too much for the long term.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Running-Mastodon/Tuning.md#using-jemalloc">this section</a> in the Mastodon administration docs that recommends running <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a> to reduce Mastodon’s memory footprint.</p>

<p>It was easy to do and has allowed me to run on the low-end Droplet from DigitalOcean without running out of memory. I still need to upgrade to the next size when I upgrade Mastodon, but then I can size back down for normal operation.</p>
