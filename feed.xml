          <span class="note"><p>I really enjoyed this. It’s organized around three parts: a short history of shared interests between scientists and the artistic avant-garde, particularly in the early twentieth century; a catalog of recent and contemporary artists organized according to the scientific disciplines from which thy take material, techniques, and inspiration; and a short theoretical discussion of what these connections may mean for the practice of both art and science in the near future.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>This was an enjoyable espionage thriller told from the perspectives of two old Oxford friends who end up on either side of the Munich Conference. I’ve read another one of Harris’s novels and appreciate his sensitivity to historical detail. It’s reminiscent of Le Carré novels where the spycraft and suspense all feel very human-scale.</p>

<title>Aaron Koblin on art as experimentation</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>I do see art as experimentation. It’s fundamentally he process of combining things that have never been combined before. I’m fascinated by the process of translating ideas from one reality into another and ways that systems and structures can influence and guide new creation. To some extent art is an excuse. It’s a word that we use for yet-to-be-defined progress—necessary experiments in thought space which help us define and test limits. These are experiments that allow us to question, reflect, discover, and appreciate.</p>

  <p>– <cite><a href="http://www.aaronkoblin.com/">Aaron Koblin</a> on art as experimentation, as quoted in Arthur Miller’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2FCxfHk"><em>Colliding Worlds</em></a></cite></p>

<title>Editor-Only CSS for the Elementor Page Builder</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>We’ve been experimenting recently with developing some in-house templates and tools to use on client projects based around WordPress and the <a href="http://elementor.com">Elementor</a> page builder plugin.</p>

<p>One problem that I’ve run into has been to retain the easy copy-editing benefits of using the WP administration panel and Elementor with more advanced interactive elements that might have hidden states on the initial page load. In these cases, the Elementor editor, which uses your theme’s stylesheet to give you WYSIWYG editing, will also hide those elements in the editing view.</p>

<p>I haven’t found this mentioned in the Elementor documentation, but it turns out that it inserts a class <code class="highlighter-rouge">elementor-editor-active</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag while in the editor. You can add styles to your stylesheet to show or highlight special layout elements in ways they wouldn’t be displayed on the public site in order to help retain the ability to edit text using the visual editor.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re losing some of the WYSIWYG fidelity of using precisely the same styles as the public site, but some thoughtful presentation choices can minimize that downside.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The organizational conceit of this book is to dedicate each chapter to short history of the development of a different videogame, and Schreier does a deft job of teasing a different thematic thread from each one. The unifying frame is the hardships the tension between rigid market schedules and the unpredictability of the medium can put on development teams, but each experience sounds terrible in its own way. Stardew Valley has basically been the entirety of my videogame universe for the past two years, so I was happy to see that represented, but I also found the coverage the AAA blockbuster projects much more interesting than I expected.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Ketogenic diets have been popular among tech people I’m aware of on the Internet for a while now, and I’ve been curious but have a difficult time not bouncing off of the voice of most diet books (and really self-help/self-improvement books generally). This author has his own line of “primal” (which as far as I can tell is branded paleo) food products and references them from time to time, but even with that the signal to sales noise ratio here is better than the average book of this sort. Skimming and following his citations to researchers was beneficial and having a prescribed meal plan to help get started with a new dietary regime is useful. This was a useful way to get into understanding what people are trying to accomplish in eating this way while requiring only a minimum amount of nose-holding against the self-promotional parts and references to some of the silly fellow traveler dietary stuff (e.g., “leaky gut syndrome”) that comes along with this topic that seems to have a kernel of non-bullshit at its core.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I remember seeing this at Books on the Square when I was on a fellowship in Providence, RI when it first came out in 2010, and it’s taken me this long to get around to reading it. In the meantime, Pizzolatto has become famous for <em>True Detective</em>, so I may have gotten around to this regardless, but the book originally drew my attention as an aficionado of Galveston the place rather than interest in Pizzlatto as a writer. Having read it, Pizzolatto the writer is enjoyable. This is a good neo-noir novel with a strong sense of setting and an interesting protagonist. I wish I hadn’t initially been drawn by my love of Galveston the place, though. If it were simply a generic Gulf South setting, everything would be spot on, but whenever Pizzolatto is specific in a way that is supposed to lend verisimilitude, he gets just specific enough to land wrong, for example, describing turning from one street to another into a sunset that wouldn’t be in that direction or taking a highway past an area that would not in fact be visible from the road there. I was not searching for these details, and they don’t really matter, but it was a new experience for me to know a place so well and to have the fictional traversal of the space constantly rubbing up against my mental map of it. I imagine this feeling is a commonplace for people who know LA or New York better than I do.</p>

<title>Chris Coyier on Complexity in Web Development</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>I suspect it doesn’t need any more complexity, and literally nobody is advocating it does. That’s why that <em>the web is a big place</em> sentiment is so useful. We talk about complexity, but it’s all opt-in. A wonderfully useful (and simple) website of a decade ago remains wonderfully useful and simple. Fortunately for all involved, the web, thus far, has taken compatibility quite seriously. Old websites don’t just break.</p>

<title>Leondardo da Vinci, kitchen manager</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>Master Leonardo da Vinci’s kitchen is a bedlam. Lord Ludovico Sforza told me that the effort of the last months had been to economize upon human labor, but now, instead of the twenty cooks the kitchens once employed, there are closer to two hundred persons milling in the area, and none that I could see cooking but all attending to the great devices that crowded up the floors and walls – and none of which seemed behaving in any manner useful or for which it was created. At one end a great waterwheel, driven by a raging waterfall, spewed and spattered forth its waters over all who passed beneath and made the floor a lake. Giant bellows, each twelve feet long, were suspended from the ceilings, hissing and roaring with intent to clear the fire smoke, but all they accoplished was to fan the flames. … And through this stricken area wandered horses and oxen … dragging Master Leondard’s floor-cleaning devices – performing their tasks valiantly, but also followed by another great army of men to clean the horses’ messes.</p>

  <p>– <cite>From a 1482 report describing the Sforza castle kitchen as managed by a 30-year-old Leonard da Vinci, as printed on the insert in the recent food-themed <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/support/">postcard pack from <em>Public Domain Review</em></a></cite></p>

<title>HTTPS on Github Pages Custom Domains with Cloudflare</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I’m hosting our archive site for <a href="https://theappendix.net"><em>The Appendix</em></a> on Github Pages because it’s free and it helps shield me from having to pay for the periodic bandwidth spike when an article or blog post gets popular for a few days on Reddit.</p>

<p>It has increasingly been bothering me that a  big problem with this solution long-term was the growing movement towards privileging web content served over HTTPS by services like Google as it conflicts with Github Pages inability to serve sites with custom domains over HTTPS. I was listening to the <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/033/large-files-cdns-image-compression-video-hosting-and-big-zips">Syntax podcast</a> yesterday when Wes made an aside that even free-tire <a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> get served over HTTPS for free. That seemed like a solution to my problem.</p>

<p>I signed up for Cloudflare this morning, added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">theappendix.net</code> domain, changed my DNS settings to point to Cloudflare, and checked about 15 minutes later to find the site being served over HTTPS. Done.</p>

<p>This site is supposed to be an archive that will hopefully persist with little maintenance for a long, long time. In putting Cloudflare in front of it, I’ve added another layer of dependency. However, Cloudflare sits in front of the hosting. All I have to do to remove my dependency on it if it should disappear is to change my DNS settings again. As long as I’m maintaining the <code class="highlighter-rouge">theappendix.net</code> domain name I’ll be able to support at least that level of maintenance supervision.</p>

<p>One caveat is that Cloudflare’s free certificate is a shared SSL certificate which presents some security concerns. In the context of the problem I am trying to solve—providing a Github Pages-hosted static site over HTTPS—I don’t think those concerns are relevant; however, it will not be the correct approach to security for all situations.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’ve had this on the shelf since very soon after it came out. It has followed me through several moves and for some reason never made it off the to read pile. I’m glad I finally did read it, and it was actually interesting to now read it with a bit of time having passed and in the context of our Trumpist/nativist era. Keefe centers his narrative around the rise of a Fujianese “snakehead” (or human smuggler) based in New York’s Chinatown known as Sister Peng to explore the global and local dynamics of human smuggling, particularly between Fuzhou and the United States in the 1990s. It was both informative as a piece of political journalism and entertaining on the level of true crime narrative.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>It was interesting to read this in our current moment of rising worry over authoritarianism and to consider its having been written in 1968 as a reflection on one major twentieth-century moment of political upheaval from the midst of another. The most compelling part of the work is the interdisciplinary of the sources and cultural productions Gay surveys: theater, dance, music, film, literature, poetry, painting, etc.  Throughout these fields of creative endeavor—though to varying degrees—he argues that intellectual and creative elites were frequently not sufficiently committed to the revolutionary aims of the Republic and that this lack of cultural commitment was a strong contributor to its failure.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>Caesar blends a history of professional marathoning and marathon training with a synthesis of contemporary research in fitness and physiology in this exploration of elite marathoners’ assault on the two hour mark. The narrative is centered on the Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai and weaves together thematic chapters on topics including the development of Kenyan distance running, doping, the tension between amateurism and professionalism in the history of the sport, and the rise of the city marathon circuit. I listened to this as an audiobook which doesn’t always lend itself well to keeping a meta-narrative in one’s head, but Caesar does an exceptional job of balancing individual anecdotes with returns to the connective tissue of his argument(s).</p>

<title>Forced HTTPS in Chrome on Local .dev Domains</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I used to use .dev as a domain extension for doing local development using <a href="http://mamp.info">MAMP Pro</a>, but 
I have had to switch to using .local instead because Safari and Chrome both now force any 
domain ending in .dev to load over HTTPS which I’m not running for my local development 
environments.</p>

<p>Google made this decision (and Apple is following their lead) because Google bought the 
rights to provide .dev as a publicly available TLD and will be putting them on sale in 
May of this year. For now the browser-side enforcement of the HTTPS-only policy is 
inconvenient, but it means making a change that I would need to make regardless to avoid 
potential collisions in the future.</p>

<p>This is a new enough situation that I still have old projects for which I haven’t changed the 
settings. When I try to load them, I get the message that the server is unavailable even though 
I’m looking at MAMP Pro chugging away right in front of me. This happens sufficiently infrequently 
that it still takes me about five or ten minutes of confusion to remember the cause and 
change over to a .local domain.</p>

<p>As usual, the hope is that writing up a short note will mean I remember what’s going on 
next time.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>The first in a series of two mysteries based on the conflicting unreliable narrator pair of a middle-aged detective and a precocious teenage girl. It was fun and the texture of its 1980’s California setting was enjoyable. I will read the next one.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>Kaplan is a journalist who focuses on national security and this history of cyberwar focuses much more on the security implications of computer surveillance, intrusion, and sabotage than it does on the mechanics of it. It’s a useful history from that perspective. I listened to it as an audiobook and did so over too long a time, so this may be on me, but I have the impression that the construction of this story from anecdotal episodes meant that there was not a lot of thematic development. I am glad to have read it, but also want more.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I appreciate this genre of computing histories in which the author(s) have a keen sense of the technical detail they are covering and recreate historical technical decisions at a relatively detailed granularity. It is not so specific as <a href="http://tinaja.computer/2017/04/07/disrupted-and-blitzed.html"><em>The Cuckoo’s Egg</em></a>, but it does remind me of that in this regard. The authors tell the story of the creation of the ARPANET in great detail and signal towards its evolution into the Internet. As I get more interested in reading platform studies, I wish there were a bit more critical analysis of the historical sources, but the work is also twenty years old and written for a trade press, so this is not a surprising omission.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>An atmospheric spy story set in 1989 Berlin with defections, double crosses, and a stark visual style. The action unravels in a series of effective flashbacks from a debriefing of the protagonist. I’ve had this one lying around for forever and regret that it’s taken my desire to see the film adaptation <em>Atomic Blonde</em> to finally get into it. Will move on to the second book in the series immediately.</p>
