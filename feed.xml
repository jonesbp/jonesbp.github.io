          <span class="note"><p>A late 80s techno-thriller with a painter-hacker protagonist who has to explain personal computing fundamentals to his partners on a corporate espionage gig. A decent page-turner that is the first in a series on which I plan to follow through.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Roberts uses the gift of a printed edition of a late fifteenth-century Florentine geography to two Ottoman rulers as a jumping off point to explore the ‘rediscovery’ of geography and the materiality of knowledge and exchange in the late medieval and early modern Mediterranean world. He expands on the existing trend in complicating the supposedly transformative and modernizing effects taof the reintroduction of Ptolemy’s <em>Geography</em> into European intellectual life, but his primary contribution is in exploring the specific material characteristics of the book in question to identify the local peculiarities of commerce, geopolitics, and religion that shaped a Mediterranean world traditionally presumed to be aggressively transnational and multicultural.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p><em>Zodiac</em> was only Stephenson’s second novel, and it is interesting to read something with his voice in which some of his more idiosyncratic qualities (long technical digressions, large-scale world-building at the expense of plotting, etc.) have yet to develop. It’s a relatively short and tight thriller about corporate corruption and ecopolitics with a late 80s Generation-X-y tone that is evocative of the era.</p>

<title>Sean Roberts on the Materiality of Books</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>What we can learn about books and their relationship to the ideas they supposedly contain has everything to do with the ways in which people interacted with them and the ways in which books conditioned those interactions. In short, another way of asking what we can learn from books might be to ask <em>how</em> we learn from books. At a moment when so many of us are moving ever more rapidly away from “hard copies” and embracing eBooks of all varieties, it is worth remembering that the material properties of books long set important conditions for their reading. Indeed, even the electronic simulacra to which we now find ourselves accustomed imitate physical acts like turning pages, inserting ribbons, and dog-earing corners. Virtual book collections take on the appearance of wooden shelves and follow organizational schemes derived from physical libraries. All such mimicry, of course, comes at great expense both to processing resources and programming hours. Yet it is deemed indispensable because reading remains a stubbornly material act.</p>

  <p>– <cite>Sean Roberts, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/printing-a-mediterranean-world-florence-constantinople-and-the-renaissance-of-geography/oclc/900039945">Printing a Mediterranean World: Florence, Constantinople, and the Renaissance of Geography</a>, p. 175.</cite></p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is another entry in the Boss Fight Books series that is as much personal memoir as exploration of the game itself. Knorr interrogates gamer nostalgia through a thorough analysis of the game mechanics and level design of Super Mario Bros. 3 in the context of the widely held consensus that is a great, if not the greatest, platform game ever made. Along the way, her own nostalgia for childhood family interactions around the game adds an additional layer to the contingent nature of media experience.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>In this readable account, Brynjolfsson and McAfee outline some of the tensions between conventional economic wisdom and new realities of labor and markets in an age of computational abundance. While not discounting the looming hardships for many workers, they are generally sanguine about the continued need for human labor provided that training is geared to maximizing those human strengths for which machines can serve only as complements, rather than substitutes. As with so many business books, the historical foundations of some of their arguments make their shallow approach to historiography a bit disappointing. The work’s strength comes from the pair’s clear explication of policy prescriptions from their analysis.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>Having never done more than hacked together limited rough-and-ready custom one-off changes to WordPress themes, I felt like I need a good A-Z overview of the world of WordPress development as a foundation for a project I’m working on. Spending a week or so with this book following a single path orchestrated by a constant and consistent author saved me a lot of the time and confusion I’ve been wasting on abortive strolls through developer blogs and howtos over the last few months.</p>

<title>Rebecca Solnit on Privilege and Obliviousness</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>This is why I always pair privilege with obliviousness; obliviousness is privilege’s form of deprivation. When you don’t hear others, you don’t imagine them, they become unreal, and you are left in the wasteland of a world with only yourself in it, and that surely makes you starving, though you know not for what, if you have ceased to imagine others exist in any true deep way that matters. This is about a need for which we hardly have language or at least not a familiar conversation.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Osborn selects an interesting framing for her <em>Hello Web App</em> books: sharing only the minimum necessary information to get a web application up and running in a browser with limited programming experience and essentially no computer science fundamentals. The first of these two books provides a kind of paint-by-numbers template for building a simple Django CRUD application in Python.  Having learned by this sort of trial and error herself, Osborn has a good sense of what is necessary and in what order for the beginner to get a satisfying, tangible project up and running as quickly as possible. However, Osborn necessarily makes some assumptions in how she will limit her scope in order to keep things beginner-friendly, and it will take a certain kind of learner to feel free in breaking those assumptions and making their own experimentations when it comes time to grow beyond this template.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I bought this Kindle Single a couple of weeks after the election last fall, but have only now gotten around to reading it. I’ve always had something of a <a href="https://twitter.com/jonesbp/status/860151673637011458">soft spot</a> for Alex Jones despite his becoming a less benign force in the world these days—perhaps he never was benign after all—and Jones’s career-making Bohemian Grove documentary was actually the result of a lark proposed by Ronson. As a result, Ronson’s more personal, and even sympathetic, treatment of Jones as both a person and character appeals to me as being truer than the wholesale condemnation that is more typical of this moment. It also means that Ronson was able to get access to some backstage conversations between Jones, his crew, and associates like Roger Stone that are batshit crazy and fascinating.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p><em>Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts</em> is the second in a series of books introducing novice developers to building a web app with Django. Where the first installment provides a walkthrough for building a CRUD app from start to finish, the second book is more of a recipe book for specific features: a messaging system or Stripe integration, for example. The examples are helpful and include functionality that almost any web app project will require, but the shift in approach will mean that true novices should spend some time working on whatever they’ve based on their time with the first book before looking to this one for features to add. There is not enough to the demonstration project in the first book to support adding most of these features as anything other than demonstrations.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Most Cory Doctorow novels work better for me as ‘idea novels’ than as stories in themselves. His tendency to have characters break into multi-paragraph monologues outlining the political ramifications of some aspect of maker culture or copy protection almost never serves the pacing of his plots well. However, I read all of them and am always compelled by at least some part of them to think about something new. <em>Walkaway</em> was perhaps the most Doctorow-ish of novels in both these good and bad senses. I read it relatively quickly and mostly enjoyed myself most of the time, but having finished I may remember my ambivalence above another sensation of reading it.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The first of the Lord Wolsey mysteries I’ve read—this one has him undercover as a copy writer to investigate a suspicious death at an advertising firm. There are clear Wodehousian influences in Sayers’s treatment of her protagonist, and the mystery itself unfolded nicely. From a historical perspective the social commentary on advertising, recreational drug use, and consumerism was interesting.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>It can be easy to get into patterns of knee jerk rejection of these businesses, particularly Uber, with the stories in the news about the labor and housing problems caused by these business models. I think Stone is fundamentally more sympathetic to the goals of these two businesses than I am, but generally he provides an even-handed account that saves room for critique. I agree that these businesses are likely signals of a new economy, but I don’t know hat I am quite as enthusiastic about that possibility as Stone is. It will be interesting to see what happens when these business models become sufficiently common that they don’t require a connection to messianic founders to be viable.</p>

    <p>Last night I started a new side project for the first time in over a year. I installed Django, I initialized a Git repository, and I created an app.</p>

<p>For the last several months, I have been putting pressure on myself to study and learn some new skills. I have made some progress, but also find myself going for long periods without working with these materials.</p>

<p>The feeling of having a project, for me, makes things different. I have a bucket to put this learning into and a scaffolding on which to try out some of these ideas. I have somewhere to go and do something when I find myself with a free 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I’m excited to feel this way again.</p>

<title>Mapping Caps Lock to Escape in macOS Sierra</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I use Vim and command mode in any GUI editors that support it, so I’m hitting the Esc key hundreds of times a day. I’ve always been curious about mapping my Caps Lock key to escape to cut down on the distance I have to reach, but it used to require <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127591/using-caps-lock-as-esc-in-mac-os-x#8437594">quite a bit of complexity</a>.</p>

<p>I recently moved to a new MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and a virtual Esc key, so I decided to look into it again.</p>

<p>As of macOS Sierra 10.12.1, it’s incredibly simple.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open System Preferences</li>
  <li>Go to the Keyboard pane and select the Keyboard tab</li>
  <li>Click the Modifier Keys… button on the bottom right</li>
  <li>From the popup menu to the right of “Caps Lock (⇪) Key”, select “⎋ Escape”</li>
</ol>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Dan Lyons’s memoir of his time as a conspicuously older employee in the twenty-something culture of HubSpot is a readable and entertaining evisceration of both the obvious and some of the more insidious poisonous aspects of Silicon Valley workplace culture. His experience as a tech journalist at <em>Newsweek</em> and elsewhere means that he also from time to time has some interesting insights into the strengths (and more often weaknesses) of HubSpot’s business which makes more edifying reading than a simple tour through a horror show.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I love post-mortem and process reading. <em>The Cuckoo’s Egg</em> is essentially a narrativization of Cliff Stoll’s logbook of a months-long surveillance of a hacker on his Berkeley computer lab’s Unix systems, and I found the sincere, guileless enthusiasm and detail with which he chronicled his work fascinating. From a historical perspective, the different level of infosec expectations at relatively sensitive sites on this early Internet compared versus basic consumer security expectations more than thirty years later is striking.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I use Git all day every day but, probably like most, only barely scratch the surface of its functionality. From a practical standpoint, Demaree’s book also does not go particularly deep into esoteric features of the software; I might have learned one or two practical tips and tricks. The book is instead a concise, accessible encapsulation of Git’s design perspective meant to help people engage with it on its own terms. As with many of the books in the <a href="https://abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a> series, its strength comes in the tightness and directness of its purpose. It’s difficult to point to a single insight that I have not yet encountered elsewhere or stumbled upon on my own, but I nonetheless have a better sense of what to expect from Git from encountering all of these ideas together, organized in this way, and articulated this clearly and succinctly.</p>

    </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Having spent last year in Berlin (and returning this year for the summer), I’ve been getting back into reading twentieth century European for the first time in roughly twenty years. Having heard about <em>Blitzed</em> on the <a href="http://dobyfriday.com/19">Do By Friday</a> podcast, I thought it would introduce a lighter vein to that area of my reading. Ohler is not as historiographically disciplined as a writer trained as a historian might be, but his account is nonetheless at least very suggestive and is certainly entertaining and disturbing. Sometimes the account—particularly in its riffs on the relationship between Hitler and his private physician—may indulge a little too much in the salacious for my tastes, but Ohler’s central conceit that the story of Hitler’s dependency and perhaps addictions is essential for its subversion of Nazism’s claim to moral purity is convincing.</p>

<title>Ben Thompson on Specialized AI</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>What is kind of amusing — and telling — is that as John McCarthy, who invented the name “Artificial Intelligence”, <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/1/144824-artificial-intelligence-past-and-future/fulltext">noted</a>, the definition of specialized AI is changing all of the time. Specifically, once a task formerly thought to characterize artificial intelligence becomes routine — like the aforementioned chess-playing, or Go, or a myriad of other taken-for-granted computer abilities — we no longer call it artificial intelligence.</p>
