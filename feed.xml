<title>Editor-Only CSS for the Elementor Page Builder</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>We’ve been experimenting recently with developing some in-house templates and tools to use on client projects based around WordPress and the <a href="http://elementor.com">Elementor</a> page builder plugin.</p>

<p>One problem that I’ve run into has been to retain the easy copy-editing benefits of using the WP administration panel and Elementor with more advanced interactive elements that might have hidden states on the initial page load. In these cases, the Elementor editor, which uses your theme’s stylesheet to give you WYSIWYG editing, will also hide those elements in the editing view.</p>

<p>I haven’t found this mentioned in the Elementor documentation, but it turns out that it inserts a class <code class="highlighter-rouge">elementor-editor-active</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag while in the editor. You can add styles to your stylesheet to show or highlight special layout elements in ways they wouldn’t be displayed on the public site in order to help retain the ability to edit text using the visual editor.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re losing some of the WYSIWYG fidelity of using precisely the same styles as the public site, but some thoughtful presentation choices can minimize that downside.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The organizational conceit of this book is to dedicate each chapter to short history of the development of a different videogame, and Schreier does a deft job of teasing a different thematic thread from each one. The unifying frame is the hardships the tension between rigid market schedules and the unpredictability of the medium can put on development teams, but each experience sounds terrible in its own way. Stardew Valley has basically been the entirety of my videogame universe for the past two years, so I was happy to see that represented, but I also found the coverage the AAA blockbuster projects much more interesting than I expected.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>Ketogenic diets have been popular among tech people I’m aware of on the Internet for a while now, and I’ve been curious but have a difficult time not bouncing off of the voice of most diet books (and really self-help/self-improvement books generally). This author has his own line of “primal” (which as far as I can tell is branded paleo) food products and references them from time to time, but even with that the signal to sales noise ratio here is better than the average book of this sort. Skimming and following his citations to researchers was beneficial and having a prescribed meal plan to help get started with a new dietary regime is useful. This was a useful way to get into understanding what people are trying to accomplish in eating this way while requiring only a minimum amount of nose-holding against the self-promotional parts and references to some of the silly fellow traveler dietary stuff (e.g., “leaky gut syndrome”) that comes along with this topic that seems to have a kernel of non-bullshit at its core.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I remember seeing this at Books on the Square when I was on a fellowship in Providence, RI when it first came out in 2010, and it’s taken me this long to get around to reading it. In the meantime, Pizzolatto has become famous for <em>True Detective</em>, so I may have gotten around to this regardless, but the book originally drew my attention as an aficionado of Galveston the place rather than interest in Pizzlatto as a writer. Having read it, Pizzolatto the writer is enjoyable. This is a good neo-noir novel with a strong sense of setting and an interesting protagonist. I wish I hadn’t initially been drawn by my love of Galveston the place, though. If it were simply a generic Gulf South setting, everything would be spot on, but whenever Pizzolatto is specific in a way that is supposed to lend verisimilitude, he gets just specific enough to land wrong, for example, describing turning from one street to another into a sunset that wouldn’t be in that direction or taking a highway past an area that would not in fact be visible from the road there. I was not searching for these details, and they don’t really matter, but it was a new experience for me to know a place so well and to have the fictional traversal of the space constantly rubbing up against my mental map of it. I imagine this feeling is a commonplace for people who know LA or New York better than I do.</p>

<title>Chris Coyier on Complexity in Web Development</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>I suspect it doesn’t need any more complexity, and literally nobody is advocating it does. That’s why that <em>the web is a big place</em> sentiment is so useful. We talk about complexity, but it’s all opt-in. A wonderfully useful (and simple) website of a decade ago remains wonderfully useful and simple. Fortunately for all involved, the web, thus far, has taken compatibility quite seriously. Old websites don’t just break.</p>

<title>Leondardo da Vinci, kitchen manager</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>Master Leonardo da Vinci’s kitchen is a bedlam. Lord Ludovico Sforza told me that the effort of the last months had been to economize upon human labor, but now, instead of the twenty cooks the kitchens once employed, there are closer to two hundred persons milling in the area, and none that I could see cooking but all attending to the great devices that crowded up the floors and walls – and none of which seemed behaving in any manner useful or for which it was created. At one end a great waterwheel, driven by a raging waterfall, spewed and spattered forth its waters over all who passed beneath and made the floor a lake. Giant bellows, each twelve feet long, were suspended from the ceilings, hissing and roaring with intent to clear the fire smoke, but all they accoplished was to fan the flames. … And through this stricken area wandered horses and oxen … dragging Master Leondard’s floor-cleaning devices – performing their tasks valiantly, but also followed by another great army of men to clean the horses’ messes.</p>

  <p>– <cite>From a 1482 report describing the Sforza castle kitchen as managed by a 30-year-old Leonard da Vinci, as printed on the insert in the recent food-themed <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/support/">postcard pack from <em>Public Domain Review</em></a></cite></p>

<title>HTTPS on Github Pages Custom Domains with Cloudflare</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I’m hosting our archive site for <a href="https://theappendix.net"><em>The Appendix</em></a> on Github Pages because it’s free and it helps shield me from having to pay for the periodic bandwidth spike when an article or blog post gets popular for a few days on Reddit.</p>

<p>It has increasingly been bothering me that a  big problem with this solution long-term was the growing movement towards privileging web content served over HTTPS by services like Google as it conflicts with Github Pages inability to serve sites with custom domains over HTTPS. I was listening to the <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/033/large-files-cdns-image-compression-video-hosting-and-big-zips">Syntax podcast</a> yesterday when Wes made an aside that even free-tire <a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> get served over HTTPS for free. That seemed like a solution to my problem.</p>

<p>I signed up for Cloudflare this morning, added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">theappendix.net</code> domain, changed my DNS settings to point to Cloudflare, and checked about 15 minutes later to find the site being served over HTTPS. Done.</p>

<p>This site is supposed to be an archive that will hopefully persist with little maintenance for a long, long time. In putting Cloudflare in front of it, I’ve added another layer of dependency. However, Cloudflare sits in front of the hosting. All I have to do to remove my dependency on it if it should disappear is to change my DNS settings again. As long as I’m maintaining the <code class="highlighter-rouge">theappendix.net</code> domain name I’ll be able to support at least that level of maintenance supervision.</p>

<p>One caveat is that Cloudflare’s free certificate is a shared SSL certificate which presents some security concerns. In the context of the problem I am trying to solve—providing a Github Pages-hosted static site over HTTPS—I don’t think those concerns are relevant; however, it will not be the correct approach to security for all situations.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’ve had this on the shelf since very soon after it came out. It has followed me through several moves and for some reason never made it off the to read pile. I’m glad I finally did read it, and it was actually interesting to now read it with a bit of time having passed and in the context of our Trumpist/nativist era. Keefe centers his narrative around the rise of a Fujianese “snakehead” (or human smuggler) based in New York’s Chinatown known as Sister Peng to explore the global and local dynamics of human smuggling, particularly between Fuzhou and the United States in the 1990s. It was both informative as a piece of political journalism and entertaining on the level of true crime narrative.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>It was interesting to read this in our current moment of rising worry over authoritarianism and to consider its having been written in 1968 as a reflection on one major twentieth-century moment of political upheaval from the midst of another. The most compelling part of the work is the interdisciplinary of the sources and cultural productions Gay surveys: theater, dance, music, film, literature, poetry, painting, etc.  Throughout these fields of creative endeavor—though to varying degrees—he argues that intellectual and creative elites were frequently not sufficiently committed to the revolutionary aims of the Republic and that this lack of cultural commitment was a strong contributor to its failure.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Caesar blends a history of professional marathoning and marathon training with a synthesis of contemporary research in fitness and physiology in this exploration of elite marathoners’ assault on the two hour mark. The narrative is centered on the Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai and weaves together thematic chapters on topics including the development of Kenyan distance running, doping, the tension between amateurism and professionalism in the history of the sport, and the rise of the city marathon circuit. I listened to this as an audiobook which doesn’t always lend itself well to keeping a meta-narrative in one’s head, but Caesar does an exceptional job of balancing individual anecdotes with returns to the connective tissue of his argument(s).</p>

<title>Forced HTTPS in Chrome on Local .dev Domains</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I used to use .dev as a domain extension for doing local development using <a href="http://mamp.info">MAMP Pro</a>, but 
I have had to switch to using .local instead because Safari and Chrome both now force any 
domain ending in .dev to load over HTTPS which I’m not running for my local development 
environments.</p>

<p>Google made this decision (and Apple is following their lead) because Google bought the 
rights to provide .dev as a publicly available TLD and will be putting them on sale in 
May of this year. For now the browser-side enforcement of the HTTPS-only policy is 
inconvenient, but it means making a change that I would need to make regardless to avoid 
potential collisions in the future.</p>

<p>This is a new enough situation that I still have old projects for which I haven’t changed the 
settings. When I try to load them, I get the message that the server is unavailable even though 
I’m looking at MAMP Pro chugging away right in front of me. This happens sufficiently infrequently 
that it still takes me about five or ten minutes of confusion to remember the cause and 
change over to a .local domain.</p>

<p>As usual, the hope is that writing up a short note will mean I remember what’s going on 
next time.</p>

It’s a useful history from that perspective. I listened to it as an audiobook and did so over too long a time, so this may be on me, but I have the impression that the construction of this story from anecdotal episodes meant that there was not a lot of thematic development.

The authors tell the story of the creation of the ARPANET in great detail and signal towards its evolution into the Internet. As I get more interested in reading platform studies, I wish there were a bit more critical analysis of the historical sources, but the work is also twenty years old and written for a trade press, so this is not a surprising omission.</p>

<title>Media about Cities and Sea Levels</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I read Paul Greenberg’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0143127438/ref=nosim/latin031-20">American Catch</a></em> <a href="http://tinaja.computer/2017/10/19/recent-reading.html">a few months ago</a> and while I enjoyed the whole thing, the most striking section to me was the material about oysters and New York City. The combination of food history, the interface between built and natural environments, and the marine pushed a lot of my buttons.</p>

<p>A recent 99% Invisible episode entitled “<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/oyster-tecture/">Oyster-tecture</a>” takes the same material as a jumping off point to dive more specifically into the oyster reef construction efforts of one of Greenberg’s subjects. The episode is great—as 99% Invisible so often is—but I hope it will also encourage more people to read Greenberg’s book.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, another of my favorite podcasts Track Changes has an <a href="https://trackchanges.postlight.com/talking-with-kim-stanley-robinson-about-his-global-warming-epic-new-york-2140-127a72460550">interview episode</a> with Kim Stanley Robinson on which he discusses his novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B01KT7YTO6/ref=nosim/latin031-20">New York 2140</a></em> (which I still need to read) and speculated on the consequences of rising sea levels for the built environment and urban geography of New York City.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’m usually pretty skeptical of these tool-oriented cookbooks (e.g., the Dutch oven cookbook, the slow cooker cookbook, etc.) and the combination with paleo dieting is the second strike. However, it was on the recommendations table at the downtown library (which tends to have pretty good cookbook recommendations), so I picked it up. I’m not a paleo diet partisan, so I imagine I’ll ignore some of the more inconvenient substitutions made for more conventional ingredients, but I actually found a lot of the recipes here to be pretty promising. The spice profile on the ones I’ve tried has been on the mild side for my taste, but that’s an easy thing to address in future efforts.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Most of my fiction reading these days happens on a backlit Kindle Paperwhite on a couch in a toddler’s room after lights out. I found this really engrossing in that context. I love Sherman Alexie generally, and it was interesting to see him do something of a genre fiction exercise that, not surprisingly, transcends the typical limitations of the psychological thriller genre.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I really like Jason Aaron’s <em>Scalped</em>, and I like the more mystical Marvel stuff like Doctor Strange and the Silver Surfer, so it’s no surprise that I enjoyed this. I was not familiar with Chris Bachalo, but his art actually turned out to be my favorite aspect of this book.</p>

      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B072C8R69H/ref=nosim/latin031-20">Steve Knopper. <i>Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age</i>. New York: Free Press, 2009.</a>
      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is an insightful history of the media trajectory of the music industry that created the anomalous peak of the CD era and the subsequent crash into the era of online distribution. Having come of age as a music consumer basically in lockstep with the rise of the CD format over the course of the 90s, I have been intellectually aware of the business distortions of the CD era, but my personal experience has made it difficult to relate to it. This book provided helpful perspective and historical distance in that regard. It was also fascinating to read this 2009 perspective in the year 2017 since streaming has taken off. In collecting bibliographic information for this title, I’ve seen that Knopper has had a chance to put out a new edition with a chapter on streaming this year. I’m curious to check it out, but also appreciate the first edition as a historical document.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The authors’ approach in this parenting manual is to package research in developmental psychology for a popular audience. The result, for me, is a much more interesting read than a lot of “tips and tricks”-style manuals in this space, but it is still a bit weighed down by some of the repetitive tropes of the genre. The concept of integrating and accommodating opposing mental modes (individual vs. social, emotional vs. intellectual, etc.) into a whole has been a compelling goal in approaching both positive and negative behavior.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I found this novel about the mysterious death of a high-ranking  government official in Albania to be an interesting exploration of political fear, paranoia, and suspicion in the context of an authoritarian regime. The language is stark and detached in a way that creates a sensation of alienation that I imagine to be intentional, but the English translation comes by way of a French translation of the original Albanian. I’m never confident that I’m not simply over-reading a difficult translation in cases like these. Despite taking a while to get into the language, I eventually quite enjoyed it.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I enjoyed this quite a bit. It’s rather adventurous formally, presenting itself as a self-help book  with the goal of helping its reader achieve the titular goal of getting rich in the new Asia. The protagonist is the second person singular reader and the thematic chapters also trace the arc of that second person protagonist from birth through death in an unspecified, not-quite-Pakistan Asian country. The formal conceit may sound cute, but I found that it allowed Hamid to change frames from the intimately personal to the urban to the geopolitical freely. Having surrendered to the format quickly, I found it both touching and funny</p>
