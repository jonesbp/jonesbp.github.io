      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>It seems that most responses to this novel focus on the close, careful characterization of its singular protagonist. I was also impressed by this aspect, but perhaps most enjoyed the construction of the space of the American West and the evocation of the experience of moving with uncertain direction. I don’t know that it’s correct to say that I ‘enjoyed’ reading this—it is austere and brutal throughout—but I am certainly glad that I did.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I listened to this as an audiobook over the week that I moved us out of our house in Gent. I found that it worked very well in that format; Weatherford does a good job of maintaining a narrative momentum without abandoning analytical context completely. The central goal is to rescue the reputation of the Mongols—and particularly the court of Genghis Khan—from Western portrayals that would condemn them as barbarians. New to me was Weatherford’s notion that the source of these portrayals was not actually contemporaneous with the Mongol khans, but a reaction to the abuses of Tamerlane and Europeans’ conflation of these Timurids with the Mongols.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I had only seen the 1965 Richard Burton film adaptation of this. I think the visual medium of film helps remind one of the time of its creation in a way that requires a bit more active attention from the reader of the novel. Regardless of context, it is a tight, brutal spy novel. But the moral ambivalence of its main actors is relatively pat today in a that makes it difficult to remember how shocking it might have been for a lot of its readers at the height of the Cold War. It feels a bit silly to go on about this one. Of course I’ll continue to read John Le Carré novels. It’s a bit weird it’s taken me so long to get to this, one of his most, if not <em>the</em> most, notable.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I picked this up pretty quickly after the first one. It’s more of the same as the first installment (in a good way). If anything, I think the kinks of translating the live-play podcast format into a graphic novel have been worked out, making me enthusiastic for the third installment coming next year.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This history of the development and reception of NBA Jam is actually a very good case study in how the technical characteristics of a platform can define design decisions. Not overly concerned with framing things theoretically, Ali provides a pragmatic demonstration of the approach demonstrates of the effect of the medium and technology on the aesthetics and experience of the game. Personally interesting to me was to realize in a way that I could not have at a time that as a 13 year old when the game was released I was watching an epochal media transition that would define my teenage years.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Recently I have been trying to read a bit more long fiction instead of letting myself knock off quick comics reads. I saw this on the recommendations table at the library, though, and can’t pass up a Sean Philips and Ed Brubaker collaboration. Though short, it hardly qualifies as ‘light’. I found it to be a compelling and economical character study of a person struggling with the intrinsic rewards of their work and the external pressures of their legacy.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I still intend to read Kerr’s Berlin trilogy of detective novels, but when my dad dropped his paperback of this with me after his Thanksgiving visit, I picked it up. It was a good thriller with very effective pacing. The work with historical setting makes me look forward to reading those Berlin novels, even though the particular setting of political intrigue in FDR’s cabinet, the Nazi regime, and several WWII-era national intelligence services was of less immediate interest to me personally.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This the first Tom Robbins book I’ve ever read. I have the sense that he’s a bit polarizing. I think the people that don’t like him think his maximalist prose is evidence of a lack of care or discipline. I think I disagree; I think his swirling paragraphs and metaphors and digressions are too frequently exhilarating or funny to be an accident. I don’t think a writer could ride the wild omnidirectional contradictions of character and motivation in everyone involved in this story without an extreme amount of care. I have only ended up here, however, after a very slow start when I found all the layering and breathlessness and bouncing energy a little overwhelming. To use language the protagonist Switters might, I found it all a bit too vivid. I think that this was an accident of personal timing, though—the fault of reading it during a huge crunch period with work. As I finished it in a more relaxed moment when I had time to sit with it for longer periods, I found myself less exhausted by it and more enthusiastic about going along for the ride.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I found this via Robin Sloan’s recently-ended Year of the Meteor newsletter. If I recall correctly, what caught my attention in Sloan’s description was the detective’s hobby for composing haiku. Reading it fulfilled my expectations for the quiet and deliberation that I anticipated this character detail might signal. It is a careful classic detective procedural that hangs on the norms and expectations of post-War Japan society. Matsumoto, it turns out, was quite prolific, but unfortunately only four of his novels are available in English translation.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>This collection of short restaurant reviews was my go-to time-filler read for the month or so before the launch of the <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org">Public Domain Review</a> reboot. Running a new build was just enough time to read another review or two. I enjoy Gold’s writing about food, but mostly it is his affection for L.A. that makes me nostalgic for my own short time there. I wish I had had this collection then.</p>

<title>Sloan on business and authorship</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>I mean: I like art! But I’ve found real satisfaction in this work, too, and I think a lot of people would—people who maybe don’t realize it; who got channeled early into things like law or science or tech. There’s a “full-spectrum-ness” to a small business that’s very satisfying; a real sense, as with books, of authorship.</p>

  <p>– <cite>From Robin Sloan’s Year of the Meteor newsletter, <a href="https://desert.glass">installment 42</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is Robin talking about his experience with running his <a href="https://fat.gold">Fat Gold</a> olive oil business and is a great distillation of my continued attraction to the multi-faceted nature of projects that are businesses over purely academic or creative projects. There’s an accountability—in a material, tangible sense, rather than a moral or intellectual one—that doesn’t frequently come from other categories of projects.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This was a more straightforward journalistic post-mortem of the development process than most of the Boss Fight Books installments have been. Having never played the game, there were some details that did not interest me that I’m sure would be more compelling to fans. I’m glad to have read it, however, for the material about the tensions in designing a game in the growing trans-media Star Wars franchise universe. The problem-solving inherent in balancing these tradeoffs between game design and the marketing imperatives of the larger media engine made for interesting material.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I continue to enjoy these small mysteries. The gay community of St. Denis and environs plays a central role, and it’s already remarkable how outdated the ostensibly “sympathetic” portrayal written by a middle-aged straight male author a few years ago feels in the contemporary context of increased focus on increased representation for queer people in media.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>KSR of contemporary science fiction authors most successfully balances the rhetorical and discursive possibilities of the genre with engaging characterization and story-telling. This had been on my list for a very long time when I eventually got around to it. It’s gotten me interested in getting back to some of my marine ecology and climatology reading I was into when I first meant to read this.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Roger MacNamee was a relatively early investor in Facebook who despite early enthusiasm has come to fear what he believes to be a lack of ethical responsibility and accountability at the top of the company. The critiques here are well-stared, but also not much new for a reader who is following the general conversation about the ethical crisis in tech. MacNamee’s perspective is that of an outsider for most of the period covered, but there are some interesting insights regarding early moments when he thinks things could have gone differently. This book is not essential reading, but I’m satisfied having listened to it as an audiobook while running errands.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I came to this for the running, having forgotten what an enthusiast Jurek is for plant-based diets. I listened to it as an audiobook (sometimes even while running) and am glad to have given t that level of intention. Jurek has an intense commitment to running and dietary discipline and sitting with his reminisciences of training and long races provided useful opportunity to reflect on my those two areas of my own life.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I bought this shortly after it came out based on a recommendation by Cory Doctorow. I understand the recommendation, particularly in the context of the time at which it was given. The setting of an authoritarian and fragmenting United States in the near future is developed with some pretty thorough and interesting world-building. The Trump era as it has proceeded since the book was written has providing some dismaying rhymes. For me, though, the book was all setting and world-building. I tended to lose the thread of why I might care what happened next aside from providing an opportunity to present the next place.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is the first entry in the Boss Fight Books series that I was a little bit disappointed by. I have never played any of the Kingdom Hearts games and am only aware of them as an object of extreme, but relatively niche, fandom. In the beginning, I was charmed by the obsessive level of detail in which the author explored the world, plot, and characterizations, but I was expecting this to be the prelude to some more analytical work to follow. That never really came. Eventually my interest in tagging along on an obsessive’s deep dive into the minutia of their enthusiasm (something I legitimately do enjoy) wore off.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>It took me a while to commit to listening to The Adventure Zone podcast, but I’ve finally made my way through the Balance campaign, so I’m reading the graphic novels. There are several elements of the podcast that pose a challenge for the translation to a graphic novel including the meta-layer of gameplay mechanics and the deus ex machina game master, the rhythm generated by the improvisational nature of the original performance, and the intrusion of allusions from outside the fictional world. All of these elements are balanced well, I think, and I particularly like the way Griffin’s game master character is handled. The artwork by Carey Pietsch is a good fit for the goofy, sincere vibe.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>These are all available to me as e-books through my library, so I’ve made them my summer indulgence reading. In the third installment of the series, the stakes and world of these stories has expanded a bit. On the one hand, I find the engagement with French colonial history in Vietnam and contemporary global economic and political pressures compelling. On the other, I hope the dynamics of the small village atmosphere won’t be disappearing.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is the fourth installment of the Bruno, Chief of Police series. It is another case of issues of the wider world disrupting village life—international students, Basque separatists, and an international diplomatic summit all feature prominently in the plot—but most of the action feels small in the way that I appreciate about this series. There is a bit of James Bond action at the end that I could do without.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The fifth installment of the Bruno, Chief of Police series shrinks things back down to the village scale, but brings in the occult as the special angle for this episode. You can feel the series settling into the tropes that work. The cast of characters from around the village get reliable face time and play their parts. Bruno’s cooking and interest in food are now familiar. The action stakes continue to be higher than in the earliest installments of the series, but somehow not as elevated as the ending that turned me off a bit in the fourth book. This will continue to be summer reading, and next week I’ll be doing my summer reading in the French Alps.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Thompson has written an ethnography of computer programmers that is very much of this moment. In contrast to, for example, Steven Levy’s <em>Hackers</em> which is now over thirty years old, there is very little celebration or hagiography here. At the same time, it is not a sensational teardown of Silicon Valley culture either. It is more a lamentation of how the participants in the utopian spirit of the 90’s failed to anticipate the pitfalls of what they were creating as a result of the culture created in the spaces (offline and online) where these coders gathered and by the epistemologies that coding practice maps onto the perspective one brings into other parts of life. In this sense, it reminds me of Paul Ford’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-love-tech-defense-difficult-industry/">recent essay</a> in WIRED about his struggle to remain enthusiastic about the tech industry in its hegemonic phase. The book finishes in an exploration of how the vocation of coding is changing—both (fitfully) expanding its ranks but also losing some of its prestige. As it becomes a trade that can secure a position in the middle class, how do we guarantee generalized access? It seems apparent that some of the same bad instincts shape the ‘solutions’ to these problem as have shaped previous eras.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This book lies somewhere between memoir and essay collection and explores both Auerbach’s personal relationship to technology and some cultural history of our relationship to data and algorithmic problem solving in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries. The idiosyncratic form of the memoir allows Auerbach to make personal juxtapositions between, for example, psychiatric profiles developed in the context of the DSM and character designs and storytelling based on the quantification tables of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules set.</p>

It was originally published serially in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> and that format suits its swashbuckling rhythm well. Chabon has clearly read broadly in romantic adventures, and I enjoyed the confidence with which a writer in such control of his tools engaged with the tropes of the genre.</p>

<title>Coupland on biography and archival abundance</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>While I was in Hebden Bridge, I looked out of the window of a coffee shop one Friday at lunchtime, and saw a small crowd of schoolchildren on a climate protest. Sensitized by being in England, it dawned on me that what I was seeing was a rebellion of the natives against the colonizers – the inhabitants of the future marshaling resistance to the colonizing present and to the extraction of the resources that they will need to thrive.</p>

  <p>– <cite>From Deb Chachra’s Metafoundry newsletter, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-72-terraforma-incognita">installment 72</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven’t yet decided whether to take this framing literally or metaphorically, but either way it struck me as apt. I am glad that Deb has returned to writing her newsletter after some downtime.</p>

<title>Building a Gatsby Site with Leaflet Maps</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>Recently I was working on a custom touring map for <a href="https://local-memory.org/athens-on-the-colorado/narratives/territory-bands">an article on <em>Local Memory</em></a>. The site is built with <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, and I use <a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> for mapping. I use <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org">React-Leaflet</a> for some convenience with treating the Leaflet maps as React components.</p>

<p>The problem comes when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">gatsby build</code>. In the Node.js environment, there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">window</code> object, and Webpack fails to build the first page it encounters where a React-Leaflet <code class="highlighter-rouge">Map</code> component is rendered.</p>

<p>The fix is to make a check against the <code class="highlighter-rouge">window</code> object in the page’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">render()</code> function before using a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Map</code> component:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="nb">window</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">undefined</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">div</span> <span class="nx">ref</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">mapWrapperRef</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="nx">className</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">map-wrapper</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
         <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Map</span> <span class="nx">ref</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">mapRef</span><span class="p">}</span>
            <span class="nx">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{{</span><span class="na">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">540px</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">}}</span>
          <span class="o">&gt;</span>
          <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">TileLayer</span>
            <span class="nx">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">https://tiles.wmflabs.org/bw-mapnik/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</span><span class="dl">"</span>
            <span class="nx">attribution</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">&amp;copy; &lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="dl">'</span>
          <span class="o">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/Map</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/div</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>    <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was enough to avoid the Webpack error, but the problem was that the map would intermittently fail to display in the built version.</p>

<p>The problem was returning <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render()</code> function which meant that there was not an element in the DOM to mount the map on when it was ready. Outputting an empty wrapper <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> rather than nothing at all from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render()</code> function when not in a browser environment satisfies both conditions.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>

<p>A related Webpack related build error can be fixed with the following in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">gatsby-node.js</code> so that the build doesn’t fail on pages that import <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-leaflet</code> because of the absence of a browser environment:</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is the second book in this series about a small-town police chief in the Dordogne. I’ve already started the third. These are effective, light English-countryside-style murder mysteries recast in a French setting. The central drama in this episode ties together anti-GMO activism and the international wine market. A satisfying quick read.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This volume collects four novellas around themes of radicalization in contemporary and near future U.S. politics. The first story about refugees in subsidized housing enacting resistance through hacking their DRM-crippled home appliances will likely be the most familiar for those who have read Doctorow’s other work. It is also the most affirming in its way. The final installment about a group of survivalist preppers was a surprise for me because its anti-hero central character serves to demonstrate the futility of his ideology on a cul-de-sac off the main path of history, reversing Doctorow’s typical rhetorical tactics.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I have enjoyed all of the Boss Fight Books volumes I have read. The approach for this one is pretty straightforward reportage on the process of how the game came to be and some biographical explication of its creator’s unique trajectory through the tradition-bound Japanese videogame industry. It is an interesting investigation of the difficulties posed in trying to work outside of genre conventions in videogame design and of the benefits of whimsy and constraints in design. While some of the volumes in this series can stand alone, this one may be of most interest to readers who have at least some familiarity with the game.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This was the founding entry in the Boss Fight Books series and lays a good foundation for the idiosyncratic editorial approach of the series. Baumann weaves the narrative of the game with memoir, connecting topics ranging from a small-town upbringing to the career of a child actor to a life-threatening health scare. A third, less-continuous narrative thread follows the game development process itself and provides opportunity for Baumann to interrogate the relationship of creators and consumers of games in the same way that the primary thread connects the way fictional narratives can help us to process the trajectories of our own experience. I think the result is a little uneven—there are parts that feel like they reach a little too far in an immature way. However, there was far less writing about videogames in this mode available when this book was written, and as a demonstration of stretching the boundaries of what one can write about videogames, it’s a great first step in this now five-year-old series.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>As the second book in a series, I wish this had trusted me a bit more to have retained the characterizations and the world-building from the first. There are more asides reminding the reader who characters and of past events than feel necessary. I will be curious to see if that persists in the third installment. The protagonist remains a bit of a cipher, but what in the first felt like characterization, with extended exposure perhaps starts to feel simply shallow. All that said, I still enjoyed reading it. I like the setting and Lin builds suspense effectively. My criticisms, I think, come from feeling like these books could be even more than they are, rather than feeling them to be failures on their own terms.</p>

When a dead body is found in the river, he gets pulled into the investigation by two women: the local sheriff and a femme fatale in the form of a touring singer. The setting is well-done and is not incidental to the mystery at play which pulls together a strands of politics in the contemporary American West. I would have enjoyed even more of that, but I was pleasantly surprised to have any.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I have been on a trend of reading light mysteries for their escapist settings recently, and this is another one. Bruno is a police chief for a small village in the Dordogne who has an appreciation for food and for the cast of unusual small-town characters in the village. In these ways it serves as a predictable and comfortable cozy mystery. The murder at the center of the story, however, is itself rather gruesome, and the legacies of colonialism and World War II that frame the conflict offer some more difficult moral dilemmas than in the typical cozy read. There are a lot of books in this series, and I think I’ll continue with it.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I had the same problem with this book as I did with Nick Bilton’s Twitter book. The scene-by-scene action is well-executed and maintains a page-turning propulsion, but I’m frequently frustrated by the absence of any explicit analytical framework. This is an interesting explanation of the development of the Silk Road and of the investigation that brought it down, but has relatively little to say about the social context that created the moment in which the Silk Road could thrive. I understand that the broader market for these business and technology book-length profiles favors this approach over a more academic one. I look forward to a future generation of books on these subjects that can afford to be less broad in their appeal.</p>

<title>Web Development on an iPad Pro</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>To get the recommendations out of the way up front, the tools I use in the workflow I describe below are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://m.do.co/c/f771f7c968c9">DigitalOcean</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ngrok.com">Ngrok</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.blink.sh">Blink</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/">Inspect</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I have been experimenting with doing web development on my iPad Pro. The main pain point has been to find a set of tools that allow me to work with a development server environment and other command line tooling (e.g., a Node.js server, a Sass preprocessor, a database server, or a static site generator) instead of static HTML files. On previous occasions I have managed to work out a few pieces of the puzzle, but never in a way that was simple enough to feel like anything more than a parlor trick. With the setup outlined below, however, I’m finally doing work on a regular basis with an array of different technology stacks and limited friction with an iPad Pro.</p>

<h3 id="the-server">The Server</h3>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f771f7c968c9">DigitalOcean</a> to run a light-weight development server, but <a href="https://linode.com">Linode</a> or any other cloud hosting provider would do the trick.</p>

<p>To connect to the server, I use the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosh_(software)">Mosh shell</a> with the <a href="https://www.blink.sh">Blink</a> app. In contrast to SSH, Mosh is designed to maintain a session over intermittent and slow connections. Mosh does this by requiring a server component to be installed on your server so that the responsibility for maintaining the session’s state is not only on the client end. On iOS, this has the added consequence of allowing a Mosh session to stay alive even when Blink is not the active app (or iOS removes it from memory entirely.) With SSH, I would likely have to make a new connection every time I returned to the terminal from doing work in my text editor.</p>

<p>The reason for the cloud server is to be able to run build tools and a ‘local’ development server, neither of which can be done on the iPad itself. However, running a development server at <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> in the cloud doesn’t do me a lot of good when I want to visit it in a web browser from my iPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://ngrok.com">Ngrok</a> allows me to set up a tunnel with a public URL to my localhost server. So I can start, for example, an <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> server in one Mosh session and then start ngrok in another. Ngrok will show me a public URL in the style of  <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://&lt;subdomain&gt;.ngrok.io</code> which I can then visit in Safari to view my changes. This bit of glue allows me to use a cloud server the same way I would use a local development environment.</p>

<h3 id="editing">Editing</h3>

<p>My favorite coding text editor on iOS is <a href="https://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a>. It has been continuously updated since the very early days of iOS, making it both robust and well-tuned to the interaction paradigms of the iOS platform.</p>

<p><a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> is a sort of central dispatch for this whole process. It is ostensibly a git client, but provides so much more functionality than that classification implies.</p>

<p>First, Working Copy can serve as a document provider, allowing me to edit my files in Textastic easily. Having created or cloned a repository in Working Copy, in Textastic tap “Open File or Folder…” under the “External Files and Folders” header in the sidebar to bring up the iOS document picker interface. You should see Working Copy in the list of Locations on the left side. In the top right, tap “Select,” then tap a repository, and finally tap “Open” in the top right to open that repository as a folder in Textastic. Now, when you edit these files in Textastic, Working Copy will be aware of the changes.</p>

<p>So now you are tracking your changes made with Textastic in Working Copy and will be able to commit and push them to your git remote. This is Working Copy’s primary purpose, but there’s another piece of functionality in Working Copy that makes it essential for working with a remote development server. With the <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/manual/ssh-upload">SSH Upload</a> feature, you can link a repository to a remote server location and have Working Copy watch for changes and upload them to that destination.</p>

<p>To summarize, the editing workflow is: edit files in Textastic; switch to Working Copy so that the app activates, notices the changed files, and syncs them to the remote server; and open a browser to view your updated code running on the server.</p>

<p>The only catch with this process is that the SSH Upload feature is not immediately easy to discover. When viewing a repo in Working Copy, you have to open the iOS share sheet and find the ‘SSH Upload’ action. Tapping that will open a panel at the top of the sidebar to configure a remote connection (by password or SSH key.) This interface is not exposed until SSH Upload has been activated for a particular repo, but once it has been configured, it will not need to be reactivated for subsequent sessions.</p>

<h3 id="previewing">Previewing</h3>

<p>With an Ngrok tunnel running on my development server, I can interact with the development version of my code with Safari or any other browser on the iPad.</p>

<p>When I’m doing large-grained, additive work where my main interest is in maintaining forward momentum, I usually just use Safari to make sure that the large scale changes aren’t resulting in any big surprises. However, a lot of my time involves testing or polishing work that requires the console or to be able to inspect CSS rules. In those cases, <a href="https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/">Inspect</a> is the best option for in-browser developer tools I’ve found so far.</p>

<p>The desktop environment has strongly shaped the received interface paradigms of in-browser developer tools, and Inspect sometimes struggles in wrangling this complexity for the touch environment. There is room for improvement here—both in Inspect itself and perhaps in the creation of more focused and fine-tuned apps designed for touch—but it’s certainly possible on iOS to do the vast majority of the things I’m doing on a regular basis with developer tools on the desktop even if it’s not always as convenient.</p>

<hr />

<p>The vast majority of these puzzle pieces have been available for quite a while now. My two recent discoveries that have made everything click into place are Ngrok and the SSH Upload feature of Working Copy. Together they get my code changes onto a live server and back out into a web browser with little enough friction that I feel free to rely on my iPad in situations when its convenience and portability would be useful.</p>

<title>Coupland on biography and archival abundance</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>On the other hand, here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter whether I, as a biographer, drive to the civic library and hang out with the reference librarians all day—in the end, I’d end up with the same information that I’d have found here at home, online. Would the bricks-and-mortar research come with a pedigree? Would I need to show Chevron gas slips and document my mileage to score points? This throws the notion of “biography” into a new light. We can all hopscotch from link to link to link—it’s what most people do now, anyway. So Why write a biography? Maybe to get a sense of how it felt to be someone else in a different time. Maybe to cast new light on an old subject. Maybe to learn new ways of thinking. Maybe to try to enter an already vanishing mode of perceiving the past, the notion that a landscape is best viewed with a single source of light—the sun, one light bulb, a lone candle, a lone writer—so that all the shadows and highlights are true to each other.</p>

  <p>– <cite>From Douglas Coupland’s <i>Marshall McLuhan: You Know Nothing of My Work!</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> journal tells me that I clipped this quotation four years ago today. I was doing a lot of reading in the middle of the night with a newborn child and a recently minted PhD and wondering what kind of writing I might be able to do outside of an academic context.</p>

<p>I still have no idea. Oops.</p>
