<title>Using Object Literals in render() in React</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I’ve been reading the <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/">Full Stack React</a> book and came across this neat trick that had never occurred to me before for whatever reason.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{{</span>
    <span class="nl">SAVING</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">input</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'Saving…'</span> <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'submit'</span> <span class="nx">disabled</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">SUCCESS</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">input</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'Saved!'</span> <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'submit'</span> <span class="nx">disabled</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">ERROR</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">input</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'Save Failed - Retry?'</span> <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'submit'</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">READY</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">input</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'Submit'</span> <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'submit'</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span>
<span class="p">}[</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">state</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_saveStatus</span><span class="p">]}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s a flag set in the state variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">_saveStatus</code> that will have one of the following values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">SAVING</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUCCESS</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ERROR</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">READY</code>. Define an object literal tieing each of four different pieces of content (in this case Submit buttons in different states) to one of these keys, and then select the appropriate piece of content by grabbing the value from the appropriate key in that object.</p>

<p>This immediately struck me as a succinct and useful technique. It had never occurred to me myself. I love it when that happens.</p>

<title>Slow Trailers</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I just came across these <a href="http://relax.thegardensbetween.com">”slow trailers”</a> for The Gardens Between today. They are three 10-15 minutes-long animated short films with ambient scores by <a href="https://timshiel.bandcamp.com/">Tim Shiel</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve found them to be compelling and soothing viewing, and I love the idea of them as promotional items. They upend the expected rhythms of online video consumption in a way that seems to pre-figure some of what players of the game can expect.</p>

<title>Nap Time</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I like taking naps. I don’t like my phone buzzing while I nap. I want to use my phone’s timer to wake me up from my nap. I don’t want to miss phone calls for days because I forgot to turn Do Not Disturb off on my phone.</p>

<p>iOS 12 came out yesterday, and I wanted to give the new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-12-the-macstories-review/7/#shortcuts">Shortcuts</a> system a whirl. I’ve used Workflow <a href="https://tinaja.computer/2015/07/13/comments-in-workflow.html">in the past</a>, but fell off the wagon when it all felt too fiddly. Workflow always felt like a big pile of (amazing) hacky workarounds; the promise of system-level integration now that it has become Shortcuts has me excited to mess around with it again.</p>

<p>So, today instead of taking a nap, I made a ’Nap Time’ shortcut.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>I want to take a nap for 30 minutes. I want a timer to wake me up after 30 minutes. I want my phone to be on Do Not Disturb during that time. I want Do Not Disturb off once I’m up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-not-disturb">Do Not Disturb</h3>

<p>There is a Shortcut action called ‘Set Do Not Disturb’ that allows you to turn on Do Not Disturb until it is turned off manually, until a prescribed time, until you leave the location where the action was invoked, the current event on your calendar ends, a Magic Variable, or the input from the previous shortcut action.</p>

<p>There is no option to set Do Not Disturb for a specified duration. So I will use the ‘Until: Time’ option and give it a time 30 minutes in the future from now.</p>

<p>There’s another action called ‘Date’ that allows you to pass either the current date (and time) or one you specify to the next action. There is another action called ‘Adjust Date’ which takes a date/time input and allows you perform a calculation against it. In this case, I will select the current date in ‘Date’ and add 30 minutes to it using ‘Adjust Date’. I now have a date/time value to pass along to ‘Set Do Not Disturb’ as the time until which I would like Do Not Disturb active.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/nap-time/shortcuts-date-math.png" style="max-width: 375px" alt="Do Not Disturb settings screenshot" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="timer">Timer</h3>

<p>Now I need to set a timer.</p>

<p>Frustratingly, Shortcuts does not have any built-in actions for the Clock app. If I hadn’t listened to a few podcasts over the last couple of months of people using Shortcuts in beta, I would have been stumped.</p>

<p>The way to get timer actions into a shortcut is to use Siri Suggestions. So activate Siri and say “Set a timer for 30 minutes.” Let it run or not. Now go back to the Shortcuts app and select Siri Suggestions in the action list and Siri will suggest to you your recent action you took with the Clock app—in this case “Start a timer for 30 minutes.”</p>

<p>This action can go as the last link your chain. You can choose whether you want to be left in the Clock app with the timer running or not when the shortcut terminates.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/nap-time/shortcuts-timer.png" style="max-width: 375px" alt="Timer shortcut screenshot" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<p>There’s a settings panel for your shortcut if you tap the toggle switch icon in the top right of the screen. There you can give your shortcut a name and icon. You can also record a Siri trigger phrase so that the new shortcut can be invoked by saying “Run ‘Nap Time’” to Siri where ‘Nap Time’ is whatever trigger phrase you’ve chosen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/nap-time/shortcuts-settings.png" style="max-width: 375px" alt="Shortcut settings screenshot" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="additions">Additions</h3>

<p>I could also have this play a playlist in Music as well, but what I would really want is for the new <a href="http://www.numerogroup.com/products/environments">Environments</a> app of Irv Teibel field recordings from the Numero Group to start up. Unfortunately it doesn’t appear to have the necessary hooks to work with Shortcuts, so I will have to start it up manually if I want to. I can at least launch the app as the last step in my workflow if I want to.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can <a href="/downloads/nap-time.shortcut">download the shortcut</a> if you would like a head start messing with this stuff. It’s fun.</p>

<title>Coupland on omniscience fatigue</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>I’ve noticed that, as we ramp up on our game-building skills and generalized knowledge about Ronald [MacDonald], we’re googling every ten seconds. The problem is, after a week of intense googling, we’ve started to burn out on knowing the answer to everything. God must feel that way all the time. I think people in the year 2020 are going to be nostalgic for the sensation of feeling clueless.</p>

  <p>– <cite>From Douglas Coupland’s 2006 novel <i>JPod</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read this when it came out, but recently picked it up off the bookshelf where it was left by friends in the house we’re living in in Gent.</p>

<p>I was struck both by the prescience of this insight and how Coupland actually is a bit behind the curve. I feel like the nostalgia for unanswered questions (or a fatigue of relative omniscience?) has already been with us for a few years.</p>

<p>Now, still two years in advance of 2020, knowledge and fact are so cheap our problem is with how many of us have decided they are worthless—a far less blissful ignorance.</p>

<title>Driftless Recordings</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>Every once in a while I’ll stumble on a collection of things that articulates a sensibility (my sensibility?) so comprehensively and surprisingly that I have to know more.</p>

<p>I recently got a notice that <a href="https://c418.org/">C418</a>–the German producer of the soundtrack for the videogame Minecraft—was releasing a new album. I own the <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha">Minecraft soundtrack on vinyl</a> because I like the music, but also because I got a kick out of the <a href="https://tinaja.computer/2016/04/26/videogames-on-vinyl.html">trend</a> for painstakingly packaged physical releases of these born-digital compositions that got under way a few years ago. I would have let this one pass me by because I just bought several new records a few days ago, but I saw the <a href="https://twitter.com/ghostramp">@ghostramp</a> account post about it on Twitter mentioning a label I’d never heard of, so I followed up.</p>

<p>It’s on a label I’d never heard of: <a href="http://www.driftlessrecordings.com/">Driftless Recordings</a>.<sup id="fnref:name"><a href="#fn:name" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I was expecting more videogame music. There is none. I scrolled down the list of records not recognizing anything, and then saw that they had a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/03/29/521813547/hayden-pedigos-greetings-from-amarillo-is-a-desert-swept-waltz-in-12-strings">Hayden Pedigo</a> record as an early release. And an ambient compilation produced for Moogfest. Videogame music composers and 12-string guitar instrumentals on the same label? I am intrigued.</p>

<p>And then there is this righteous album artwork by <a href="http://www.brianblomerth.com/">Brian Blomerth</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018/DFS037_COVER_WEB.JPG" alt="North Americans cover" /></p>

<p>for a band called North Americans I have also never heard of.<sup id="fnref:mcdermott"><a href="#fn:mcdermott" class="footnote">2</a></sup> So I watch the video I had initially scrolled past.</p>

<div class="youtube-video">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF1prRX96J8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>And it is so great. More guitar instrumentals. More ambience. Whistling. Julianna Barwick plays synth elsewhere on the record according to the review in <a href="https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/ambient-guitar-outfit-north-americans-announce-upcoming-lp-driftless-recordings">Tiny Mix Tapes</a>. It’s a cascade of more things I’m into that I previously didn’t know.</p>

<p>I get bummed out about algorithmic smoothing of taste and aesthetics, particularly online. I get bummed out about the way that online forms box in the expression of identity by forcing the self to be shared in a way that fits the data expectations of a particular platform or piece of software. And then, every once in a while, the Internet still throws up something that doesn’t make much sense as anything other than itself. This collection of stuff was that for me yesterday, and it was a blast.</p>

<p>When you buy stuff on their store, you can throw in a mystery record for another $5. I did. Can it be possible I won’t be into it?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:name">
      <p>It’s a good name. <a href="#fnref:name" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:mcdermott">
      <p>Turns out it’s not a band, but the recording name of Patrick McDermott, one of the label co-founders. <a href="#fnref:mcdermott" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>

I know Laurent Dubois from my graduate work reading the Atlantic World historiography, but since then he has become one of my favorite writers on sports as well.

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p><em>Universal Harvester</em> builds a strong sense of place in late 90s Iowa in which its quiet, suspenseful almost-horror sits neatly next to people living with loss and grief. Darnielle’s experience building characters in the small spaces of songs shows itself in his knack for finding the small exemplary. This writing felt patient and confident; I really enjoyed being in and moving slowly through this world.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Kurt Andersen traces the development of magical thinking and individualistic ‘truth’ in American culture from early English settlement to the present day. He does a good job summarizing the early modern cultural history. It’s a survey, and I’m not the imagined audience for it, but it was nice to see this perspective on early American Protestant religion in a work of popular nonfiction. Andersen’s clear interest is in the second half of the twentieth century when he argues that the American predeliction for personal truth, facilitated by the counterculture and postmodernism, allow for an explosion of non-reality-based worldviews across the political and cultural spectrum. The obvious endpoint is the era of the Trump presidency. In tying this moment to a long history fusing individualistic and supernatural worldviews into a uniquely American epistemology, Andersen helpfully challenges the idea that this Trumpist moment is some kind of catastrophic rupture rather than inherently American.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I picked this out at the comic book store with Mees having seen it mentioned before as a good book for kids. It’s a nice Nancy Drew- or Harriet the Spy-like girl-detective story about a precocious teenager who takes it upon herself to act as house detective at South Florida hotel where her father works in a early 1960s setting. The primary young characters are people of color and the teen romance is not exclusively heterosexual. The artwork is colorful and fun, and the action is mostly non-violent. It was a worthwhile read for my own enjoyment, but it’s also definitely a great option for non-superhero comics for kids.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>When I started reading the Harry Hole series, the installment available in English was <em>The Redbreast</em>, which is actually the third book in the series. Almost ten years later, it’s interesting to return to this earlier entry. It’s a page-turner the way they all are. Having spent a short time in Bangkok staying with Northern European ex-pat friends, it was interesting to see Nesbø’s frame for conflicts between Thai and ex-pat culture, particularly as he seems to experience it differently as a Northern European than I do as an American.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This was lighter reading than some Stephenson fare—more like <em>Zodiac</em> than <em>Sevenes</em>—and ends up as a sort of time-traveling heist novel that mashes up Big Science and the occult, the military and academia. The narrative is presented in letters, networked groupware messaging platforms, and journals. On both these counts it’s reminiscent of other things I’ve read recently, but far more successful. I’m not familiar with Nicole Galland, but I’m sort of curious to read her historical fiction now, and I’m glad to see indications that this is the first installment in a series.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’ve read a lot of Adam Rothstein’s non-fiction work. This is is his first novel. It’s an alternate history thriller of a (more) technocratic twentieth century United States. The thematic trappings of the setting—bureaucracy, the occult, infrastructure, futurism—are right up my alley, but sometimes the descriptive flavoring derailed the forward momentum of the plot for me. I’d like to see more if these first novel kinks were to get sorted out.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I came across this book through <a href="https://kottke.org/18/02/even-the-stiffest-people-can-do-the-splits">Jason Kottke</a> and thought it seemed interesting. I’ve been having a lot of hip flexor problems with my marathon training, so I was interested in the content itself, but I was also interested in the publishing phenomenon. I haven’t actually started the stretching program (although I still plan to), but the book as a published object definitely didn’t disappoint. The first third or so outlines the mechanics of the stretching program and actually does so in a really thoughtful and clearly presented way, but the final two thirds were the memorable part. The book ends with a fictional parable the length of a short novella about aging, keeping up appearances at the workplace, and other middle aged and middle class concerns meant to frame the shameful consequences of not being mindful about health and wellness. It is exceedingly difficult to imagine an American fitness book including the same content.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is a relatively recent debut novel, but Ide’s second novel featuring this detective had already just come out in hardcover when I finally got around to reading it. Every library I’ve been in recently has been featuring the new book heavily in its recent fiction section, and I understand why. This is light fare, but very well-executed light fare: very readable, pretty decent verisimilitude in its L.A. setting, and a relatively unusual origin story for the detective protagonist. I expect I’ll continue reading the series as it develops.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is the second novel in a series of historical detective novels set in the late nineteenth century. I haven’t read the first, but intend to go back to do so now. The bulk of the action is set in Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War, and the plot follows the hunt to identify a Turkish agent within the Russian camps. In the context of this kind of historical espionage fare, there is some formal ambition to presentation. The protagonist is not actually the detective who is central to the series, but a young progressive woman who has followed her fiancé in an modern, egalitarian betrothal from St. Petersburg to the frontlines where he has volunteered to be a cryptographer. The reader follows the efforts of the detective character, Erast Fandorin, through her eventual engagement as his assistant. Each chapter begins with fictional excerpted news reports and essays from newspapers around Europe. This device provides some continental context for events of the plot, but also insight into the characters as many of the clippings are written by journalist characters embedded in the Russian camp. This is genre fiction, but very high quality genre fiction. I intend to read the rest of them.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I ordered this immediately when I saw it reviewed by <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/02/achtung-baby-by-sara-zaske-reviewed.html">Rebecca Shuman</a>, confident that the author’s experience as an American raising a young child in Berlin would make it a pleasant nostaliga read if nothing else. It was definitely that. Anecdotes about navigating the city’s child welfare bureaucracy in German or being admonished by random old ladies for not dressing a child warmly enough hit close to home. Descriptions of particularly spectacular playgrounds were immediately familiar. The book is not simply a memoir, however, but a critique of overanxious and overbearing American parenting in the context of the post-authoritarian late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century transformation in German childcare. The critique is interesting and helps to articulate some of the general sense of difference I witness between our approach and that of other parents in the States. Some of that difference must simply come down to personality, but I think there is also an element of our having first learned to be parents in this German context. At this non-personal level, I think the book would be interested to anyone interested in reading about child development; it’s a good blend of light personal anecdote and synthesis of expert opinion and research.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This was a perfectly readable light satire of contemporary Silicon Valley culture. There is a primary narrative thread in an omniscient narrator’s voice supplemented by a variety of other kinds of texts and narrative perspectives. The primary thread is generally engaging and some of the formal experiments are entertaining and effective, but not all of them are and collectively they make me feel like this long book does not really earn its length. The story about the acquisition a struggling social network company by a rising Silicon Valley behemoth and the gradual revelation to them of a super AI could have been a tight, fun pageturner in slightly less ambitious packaging.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I really enjoyed this. It’s organized around three parts: a short history of shared interests between scientists and the artistic avant-garde, particularly in the early twentieth century; a catalog of recent and contemporary artists organized according to the scientific disciplines from which thy take material, techniques, and inspiration; and a short theoretical discussion of what these connections may mean for the practice of both art and science in the near future.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>George uses a trip she takes as a supernumerary on a container ship from the UK to Southeast Asia via the Suez Canal as occasion to explore various angles of the maritime shipping industry: labor, corruption, environmental and economic consequences, etc. It’s all interesting, and the travelogue elements of her own experience on the ship and the lives of the sailors she gets to know are particularly engaging.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This was an enjoyable espionage thriller told from the perspectives of two old Oxford friends who end up on either side of the Munich Conference. I’ve read another one of Harris’s novels and appreciate his sensitivity to historical detail. It’s reminiscent of Le Carré novels where the spycraft and suspense all feel very human-scale.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Not surprisingly coming from Ellis, this is a rather sardonic and brutal Bond story even though The Bond character himself is pretty light. It’s a good balance that triangulated a few of the movie Bond types and still feels true to the novels. The recognizable Berlin landscape details in the artwork were fun.</p>

<title>Aaron Koblin on art as experimentation</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>I do see art as experimentation. It’s fundamentally he process of combining things that have never been combined before. I’m fascinated by the process of translating ideas from one reality into another and ways that systems and structures can influence and guide new creation. To some extent art is an excuse. It’s a word that we use for yet-to-be-defined progress—necessary experiments in thought space which help us define and test limits. These are experiments that allow us to question, reflect, discover, and appreciate.</p>

  <p>– <cite><a href="http://www.aaronkoblin.com/">Aaron Koblin</a> on art as experimentation, as quoted in Arthur Miller’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2FCxfHk"><em>Colliding Worlds</em></a></cite></p>

<title>Editor-Only CSS for the Elementor Page Builder</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>We’ve been experimenting recently with developing some in-house templates and tools to use on client projects based around WordPress and the <a href="http://elementor.com">Elementor</a> page builder plugin.</p>

<p>One problem that I’ve run into has been to retain the easy copy-editing benefits of using the WP administration panel and Elementor with more advanced interactive elements that might have hidden states on the initial page load. In these cases, the Elementor editor, which uses your theme’s stylesheet to give you WYSIWYG editing, will also hide those elements in the editing view.</p>

<p>I haven’t found this mentioned in the Elementor documentation, but it turns out that it inserts a class <code class="highlighter-rouge">elementor-editor-active</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag while in the editor. You can add styles to your stylesheet to show or highlight special layout elements in ways they wouldn’t be displayed on the public site in order to help retain the ability to edit text using the visual editor.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re losing some of the WYSIWYG fidelity of using precisely the same styles as the public site, but some thoughtful presentation choices can minimize that downside.</p>
