<title>Famous Tex-Mex Quesos</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I pre-ordered <a href="http://www.homesicktexan.com">Lisa Fain</a>’s new <a href="http://amzn.to/2y67xqu"><em>Queso!</em></a> cookbook months ago when I heard about it and it arrived today. I opened it to this list of five notable Tex-Mex restaurant quesos.</p>

<p>This list is correct. I am enthusiastic about the book.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bob Armstrong Dip</strong> – Matt’s El Rancho – Austin, TX</li>
  <li><strong>Felix Queso</strong> – Felix’s (and El Patio) – Houston, TX</li>
  <li><strong>José’s Dip</strong> – Molina’s - Houston, TX</li>
  <li><strong>Kerbey Queso</strong> – Kerbey Lane – Austin, TX</li>
  <li><strong>Mag Mud</strong> – Magnolia Cafe – Austin, TX</li>
</ul>

  <li><a href="http://idlewords.com/2017/09/anatomy_of_a_moral_panic.htm"><strong>Anatomy of a Moral Panic—Idle Words—Maciej Ceglowski</strong></a>: Maciej is one of my favorite deflators of tech-industry-related hysterias and enthusiasms. His dissection of <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/potentially-deadly-bomb-ingredients-on-amazon">this recent story</a> about Amazon shopping algorithms recommending bomb-making materials is a succinct indictment of the consequences of click-bait journalism and tech credulity.</li>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’m glad to have read this after taking a bit of a break from reading comics. The art style and writing tone are well-paired, and leaning into the silliness of the Squirrel Girl character design by having her face off with Galactus of all villains was a great instinct.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The Shanghai setting is as much a character as any of the five protagonists—all of them Malaysian transplants who followed different paths to China—that circle each other in this novel. The narrative is interspersed with passages from a self-help/business-achievement memoir that tracks the trajectories of each of the main characters and eventually exposes the isolation and dissatisfaction inherent in the lives prescribed by the worldview in these books and in the rapid urbanization and globalization of China. The end felt a bit pat. I would have accepted less wrapping up, but there were a lot of open threads to tie together.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>Robin Sloan may be my favorite active novelist. Reading <em>Sourdough</em> has made me want to pick up <a href="/2015/06/28/weekly-reading.html"><em>Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore</em></a> for a third time. The quirky, questing enthusiasm of his characters and the narrow balance he strikes between small moments of magic tucked into a very recognizable quotidian present hit my pleasure-reading tastes squarely.</p>

<title>Dave Winer on Misunderstanding and Design</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes when people misunderstand a product or feature they give you ideas for how it might work or for another product or feature. Creativity sometimes comes just from not knowing something. Another reason it’s important to listen, you never know how new ideas will arrive.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’ve always been interested in having a greater understanding of the long trajectory of both the history of the Marvel story universe and of Marvel as a business, having followed comic books for only about a year as a teenager but enjoyed being generally aware of the current set of ”important” books in recent years. This chronicle is incredibly detailed which made it a little slow going when I didn’t have any outside familiarity with the material, but it was well done and interesting. I’m glad to have read it and enjoyed it, even when I moved slowly through some eras.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>There’s just enough theory here to make the reading worthwhile, but the main focus of the book is clear descriptions of mat Pilates exercises and sample routines targeted at runners’ strength and flexibility needs.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p><em>Uproot</em> is an incredibly compelling blend of artist memoir, cultural criticism, and music and travel writing that does an amazing job of addressing the influence of digital media formats, recording and production tools, broadcasting and performance technologies, and more on listening, performance, and composition in music today. I share Clayton’s affinity for some of the regional styles he explores and am completely unaware of others, so I look forward to following through on those.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The organizing principle of this book is to find ways to adjust cooking techniques and substitute ingredients in comfort foods to make them a bit more healthful while still being satisfying. Many of the recipes themselves are good, but the biggest help for me was as an exercise in finding ways to make adjustments to lower calories in other recipes.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I enjoy this series, but continue to wish there was more focus on world building and less on action. I was struck reading this by how it prefigures some of the ideas Cory Doctorow explored in <a href="http://tinaja.computer/2017/05/24/recent-reading.html"><em>Walkaway</em></a> although without the same degree of rigorous analysis. It makes for more of a page-turner, but also it is fundamentally a less ambitious work.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Listened to this as an audiobook over an incredibly long time in small, disjointed pieces, so I am not certain that I have the most fair impression of it. Some interesting detail here and there on early Bitcoin ventures, but a lot on the Silk Road felt like it had been done elsewhere and in general it felt like there was a lack of much analytical value. Helpful as a descriptive timeline for readers looking for that detail, but my impression was that wasn’t much of a point of view here.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The earlier chapters of this book focus more on design and theory and were very helpful for someone coming to API design without a lot of confidence that they even know the right questions to ask. Just having read these three or four early chapters would have been sufficient for me to be more comfortable venturing off on my own. The demonstration code in the more practically-oriented ermainder of the book is in PHP and assumes some of the author’s own libraries for which there are not necessarily ready equivalents in other languages, but it is nonetheless clearly written enough that it should be helpful demonstration for any reader.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I have read so much other Warren Ellis and have never read his most famous series. This first volume was a blast and coincidentally fell nicely in line with my accidental streak of reading late 80s and 90s stuff counter culture and hacker culture stuff recently. Interesting unexpected resonances with today’s media and political climate two decades later.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Relatively cruft-free as far as self-help/parenting books go, provides both some useful framing for approaching decisions around just how much one wants to do to run a household and discrete practical ‘tips and tricks’ for pursuing it. The “minimalist” framing frequently feels shoehorned into sections to maintain a consistent language to match the marketing-friendly title, but not to the extent of distracting from the book’s usefulness.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>This is the first installment in a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_mystery">cozy mysteries</a> about a ceramics shop owner in Albuquerque who stumbles through a series of mix-ups involving murder and contraband artifacts. The author has a political hobby horse with regards to cultural heritage policy that results in some unpleasant monologues from the protagonist from time to time, but the Albuquerque setting and light mood make it enjoyable reading. There are some first book jitters here in the writing and plotting that fortunately shake out in the second one.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>The organizing principle of this collection of interviews and essays is to encourage historians to consider the epistemological consequences of GIS as tool of inquiry and an exploratory methodology, rather than as a piece of the production process useful only for creating static maps as ‘end products’. The Gunnar Olsson and David Staley interviews and von Lünen’s concluding essay were of particular interest in helping to consider the boundaries of what geographical inquiry (and GIS in particular) can do to expand the questions available to historians.</p>

It provides a useful working definition of what constitutes ‘crowdsourcing’ (and what it is not) and runs through both positive indications for its future as a tool in a variety of fields and ethical and political problems it presents that must be addressed. A quick read and useful for shaping design considerations for possible online projects that would include collaborative peer contributions (though, per the reading, not necessarily ‘crowdsourcing’).</p>

<title>Extracting Substrings from URLs with Alfred Workflows</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I frequently find myself needing to extract a predictable piece of data from a URL, like a product id, for pasting into a file or database as metadata that might be used to contact an API or construct cleaned-up URLs in the future. The predictable formatting of the part of the URL that I care about makes this the kind of task that perfectly lends itself to simple automation, saving me the small friction of manually editing these URLs in place.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/">Alfred workflows</a> are a quick way to run this category of automation. Because the data is in a URL, I’m typically copying the URL from my web browser to the clipboard and pasting it into a text editor or field. With an Alfred workflow, I can run a script on the text from the clipboard and put my desired result back on the clipboard, cleaned up and ready to paste wherever I’d like.</p>

<p>I have several workflows that fit this general use case, and my interaction with all of them follows the following pattern:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Me:</strong> Copy my starting text to the clipboard</li>
  <li><strong>Me:</strong> Invoke the workflow with an Alfred keyword
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alfred:</strong> Grab the contents of the clipboard</li>
      <li><strong>Alfred:</strong> Run a short Python script on that data</li>
      <li><strong>Alfred:</strong> Copy the result of the script back to the clipboard</li>
      <li><em>(optionally)</em> <strong>Alfred:</strong> Paste the result of the script to the currently active window</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Me:</strong> Paste the text now in the clipboard where I want it if I haven’t already allowed Alfred to do it for me</li>
</ul>

<p>To take a specific example, we can walk through building a workflow to extract the OCLC number for an edition of a book from a <a href="http://worldcat.org">Worldcat.org</a> URL.</p>

<hr />

<p>A typical URL for a book on Worldcat.org reached through their onsite search might look like the following:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">http://www.worldcat.org/title/history-and-gis-epistemologies-considerations-and-reflections/oclc/910980341&amp;referer=brief_results</code></p>

<p>The only part I care about are the numerals between <code class="highlighter-rouge">/oclc/</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> (in this case, <code class="highlighter-rouge">910980341</code>). With that unique identifier I can construct my own tidier Worldcat.org URLs later or use their API in a script.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/images/2017/OCLC-workflow-overview.jpg" alt="Complete Alfred Workflow Screenshot" /></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows the final layout of the workflow. Assuming we have the URL on the clipboard, the workflow performs the following actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch when invoked with the keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">oclc</code> from Alfred</li>
  <li>Grab the clipboard contents with a bash script</li>
  <li>Take those contents and match them against a simple regular expression (in this case in a Python script)</li>
  <li>Copy to the clipboard and paste in the front most app</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-launch">1. Launch</h3>

<p><img src="/images/2017/OCLC-1-launch.jpg" alt="Launch Settings" /></p>

<p>In the Alfred workflow editor, create a new ‘Input’ of the ‘Keyword’ type, select the keyword you would like to use to invoke your workflow, and give it a descriptive title.</p>

<h3 id="2-grab-clipboard">2. Grab Clipboard</h3>

<p>Link your ‘Keyword’ input to a new ’Action’ of type ’Run Script’. You can leave all of the sets for this script alone; the default language choice, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash</code>, is what we want in this case. Our script will be a single bash command to grab the contents of the clipboard.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pbpaste
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="3-find-oclc">3. Find OCLC</h3>

<p>Link your <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash</code> ‘Run Script’ action to a new ’Action’ of type ’Run Script’. This time we will want to change our settings for the Language to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/python</code>. (All we’re doing is matching a regular expression which would be possible using any of the language options. I just like Python.)</p>

<p>The script is simple. We take the input from our bash script that grabbed the clipboard contents and we match it against a regular expression that essentially says “Give me the run of numerals that follow the string <code class="highlighter-rouge">/oclc/</code> in the provided text.” Finally, we write our result to standard output which is how our next Alfred action will receive it.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">re</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"{query}"</span>

<span class="n">matchObj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">r'/oclc/([0-9]*)'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">matchObj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A couple of things to note:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">query</span><span class="p">}</span></code> is a placeholder Alfred looks for in our script in order to insert whatever string of data is coming from the previous action in our workflow. It is not a standard piece of Python syntax.</li>
  <li>A ‘regular expression’ is a string of characters that defines a pattern of text. In the case of the above script, it is the part that reads <code class="highlighter-rouge">/oclc/([0-9]*)</code>, but they can be far more complex. For a good introduction to using regular expressions, you can look at the Google lesson on <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions">Python Regular Expressions</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="4-output">4. Output</h3>

<p><img src="/images/2017/OCLC-4-output.jpg" alt="Output Settings" /></p>

<p>Finally, we just want to link a new ‘Output’ of type ‘Copy to Clipboard’ and use the default content which is just to pass through the input from our Python script. Depending on the context, we could do additional formatting here by editing the text around <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">query</span><span class="p">}</span></code>.</p>

<p>In this case, I have also checked the box to ‘Automatically paste to front most app’ because that matches my needs the vast majority of the time I’m using this particular workflow, but in some cases it may be preferable to leave the result on the clipboard without automatically pasting.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s it. This approach can be repeated for any number of small extraction tasks—to take ASIN numbers from Amazon.com product links in order to construct affiliate links, for example.</p>

<p>Any single instance of this task would be trivial to perform manually, but Alfred’s ability to combine interaction with the clipboard and access to a scripting language with nice regular expression support triggered through a quick-launch command kills the tedious friction of repeat manual editing and becomes second nature.</p>
