<title>HTTPS on Github Pages Custom Domains with Cloudflare</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I’m hosting our archive site for <a href="https://theappendix.net"><em>The Appendix</em></a> on Github Pages because it’s free and it helps shield me from having to pay for the periodic bandwidth spike when an article or blog post gets popular for a few days on Reddit.</p>

<p>It has increasingly been bothering me that a  big problem with this solution long-term was the growing movement towards privileging web content served over HTTPS by services like Google as it conflicts with Github Pages inability to serve sites with custom domains over HTTPS. I was listening to the <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/033/large-files-cdns-image-compression-video-hosting-and-big-zips">Syntax podcast</a> yesterday when Wes made an aside that even free-tire <a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> get served over HTTPS for free. That seemed like a solution to my problem.</p>

<p>I signed up for Cloudflare this morning, added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">theappendix.net</code> domain, changed my DNS settings to point to Cloudflare, and checked about 15 minutes later to find the site being served over HTTPS. Done.</p>

<p>This site is supposed to be an archive that will hopefully persist with little maintenance for a long, long time. In putting Cloudflare in front of it, I’ve added another layer of dependency. However, Cloudflare sits in front of the hosting. All I have to do to remove my dependency on it if it should disappear is to change my DNS settings again. As long as I’m maintaining the <code class="highlighter-rouge">theappendix.net</code> domain name I’ll be able to support at least that level of maintenance supervision.</p>

<p>One caveat is that Cloudflare’s free certificate is a shared SSL certificate which presents some security concerns. In the context of the problem I am trying to solve—providing a Github Pages-hosted static site over HTTPS—I don’t think those concerns are relevant; however, it will not be the correct approach to security for all situations.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’ve had this on the shelf since very soon after it came out. It has followed me through several moves and for some reason never made it off the to read pile. I’m glad I finally did read it, and it was actually interesting to now read it with a bit of time having passed and in the context of our Trumpist/nativist era. Keefe centers his narrative around the rise of a Fujianese “snakehead” (or human smuggler) based in New York’s Chinatown known as Sister Peng to explore the global and local dynamics of human smuggling, particularly between Fuzhou and the United States in the 1990s. It was both informative as a piece of political journalism and entertaining on the level of true crime narrative.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>It was interesting to read this in our current moment of rising worry over authoritarianism and to consider its having been written in 1968 as a reflection on one major twentieth-century moment of political upheaval from the midst of another. The most compelling part of the work is the interdisciplinary of the sources and cultural productions Gay surveys: theater, dance, music, film, literature, poetry, painting, etc.  Throughout these fields of creative endeavor—though to varying degrees—he argues that intellectual and creative elites were frequently not sufficiently committed to the revolutionary aims of the Republic and that this lack of cultural commitment was a strong contributor to its failure.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>Caesar blends a history of professional marathoning and marathon training with a synthesis of contemporary research in fitness and physiology in this exploration of elite marathoners’ assault on the two hour mark. The narrative is centered on the Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai and weaves together thematic chapters on topics including the development of Kenyan distance running, doping, the tension between amateurism and professionalism in the history of the sport, and the rise of the city marathon circuit. I listened to this as an audiobook which doesn’t always lend itself well to keeping a meta-narrative in one’s head, but Caesar does an exceptional job of balancing individual anecdotes with returns to the connective tissue of his argument(s).</p>

<title>Forced HTTPS in Chrome on Local .dev Domains</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I used to use .dev as a domain extension for doing local development using <a href="http://mamp.info">MAMP Pro</a>, but 
I have had to switch to using .local instead because Safari and Chrome both now force any 
domain ending in .dev to load over HTTPS which I’m not running for my local development 
environments.</p>

<p>Google made this decision (and Apple is following their lead) because Google bought the 
rights to provide .dev as a publicly available TLD and will be putting them on sale in 
May of this year. For now the browser-side enforcement of the HTTPS-only policy is 
inconvenient, but it means making a change that I would need to make regardless to avoid 
potential collisions in the future.</p>

<p>This is a new enough situation that I still have old projects for which I haven’t changed the 
settings. When I try to load them, I get the message that the server is unavailable even though 
I’m looking at MAMP Pro chugging away right in front of me. This happens sufficiently infrequently 
that it still takes me about five or ten minutes of confusion to remember the cause and 
change over to a .local domain.</p>

<p>As usual, the hope is that writing up a short note will mean I remember what’s going on 
next time.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>The first in a series of two mysteries based on the conflicting unreliable narrator pair of a middle-aged detective and a precocious teenage girl. It was fun and the texture of its 1980’s California setting was enjoyable. I will read the next one.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Kaplan is a journalist who focuses on national security and this history of cyberwar focuses much more on the security implications of computer surveillance, intrusion, and sabotage than it does on the mechanics of it. It’s a useful history from that perspective. I listened to it as an audiobook and did so over too long a time, so this may be on me, but I have the impression that the construction of this story from anecdotal episodes meant that there was not a lot of thematic development. I am glad to have read it, but also want more.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I appreciate this genre of computing histories in which the author(s) have a keen sense of the technical detail they are covering and recreate historical technical decisions at a relatively detailed granularity. It is not so specific as <a href="http://tinaja.computer/2017/04/07/disrupted-and-blitzed.html"><em>The Cuckoo’s Egg</em></a>, but it does remind me of that in this regard. The authors tell the story of the creation of the ARPANET in great detail and signal towards its evolution into the Internet. As I get more interested in reading platform studies, I wish there were a bit more critical analysis of the historical sources, but the work is also twenty years old and written for a trade press, so this is not a surprising omission.</p>

The action unravels in a series of effective flashbacks from a debriefing of the protagonist. I’ve had this one lying around for forever and regret that it’s taken my desire to see the film adaptation <em>Atomic Blonde</em> to finally get into it. Will move on to the second book in the series immediately.</p>

<title>Media about Cities and Sea Levels</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>I read Paul Greenberg’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0143127438/ref=nosim/latin031-20">American Catch</a></em> <a href="http://tinaja.computer/2017/10/19/recent-reading.html">a few months ago</a> and while I enjoyed the whole thing, the most striking section to me was the material about oysters and New York City. The combination of food history, the interface between built and natural environments, and the marine pushed a lot of my buttons.</p>

<p>A recent 99% Invisible episode entitled “<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/oyster-tecture/">Oyster-tecture</a>” takes the same material as a jumping off point to dive more specifically into the oyster reef construction efforts of one of Greenberg’s subjects. The episode is great—as 99% Invisible so often is—but I hope it will also encourage more people to read Greenberg’s book.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, another of my favorite podcasts Track Changes has an <a href="https://trackchanges.postlight.com/talking-with-kim-stanley-robinson-about-his-global-warming-epic-new-york-2140-127a72460550">interview episode</a> with Kim Stanley Robinson on which he discusses his novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B01KT7YTO6/ref=nosim/latin031-20">New York 2140</a></em> (which I still need to read) and speculated on the consequences of rising sea levels for the built environment and urban geography of New York City.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I’m usually pretty skeptical of these tool-oriented cookbooks (e.g., the Dutch oven cookbook, the slow cooker cookbook, etc.) and the combination with paleo dieting is the second strike. However, it was on the recommendations table at the downtown library (which tends to have pretty good cookbook recommendations), so I picked it up. I’m not a paleo diet partisan, so I imagine I’ll ignore some of the more inconvenient substitutions made for more conventional ingredients, but I actually found a lot of the recipes here to be pretty promising. The spice profile on the ones I’ve tried has been on the mild side for my taste, but that’s an easy thing to address in future efforts.</p>

I found this really engrossing in that context.

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>This is an insightful history of the media trajectory of the music industry that created the anomalous peak of the CD era and the subsequent crash into the era of online distribution. Having come of age as a music consumer basically in lockstep with the rise of the CD format over the course of the 90s, I have been intellectually aware of the business distortions of the CD era, but my personal experience has made it difficult to relate to it. This book provided helpful perspective and historical distance in that regard. It was also fascinating to read this 2009 perspective in the year 2017 since streaming has taken off. In collecting bibliographic information for this title, I’ve seen that Knopper has had a chance to put out a new edition with a chapter on streaming this year. I’m curious to check it out, but also appreciate the first edition as a historical document.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>The authors’ approach in this parenting manual is to package research in developmental psychology for a popular audience. The result, for me, is a much more interesting read than a lot of “tips and tricks”-style manuals in this space, but it is still a bit weighed down by some of the repetitive tropes of the genre. The concept of integrating and accommodating opposing mental modes (individual vs. social, emotional vs. intellectual, etc.) into a whole has been a compelling goal in approaching both positive and negative behavior.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>I found this novel about the mysterious death of a high-ranking  government official in Albania to be an interesting exploration of political fear, paranoia, and suspicion in the context of an authoritarian regime. The language is stark and detached in a way that creates a sensation of alienation that I imagine to be intentional, but the English translation comes by way of a French translation of the original Albanian. I’m never confident that I’m not simply over-reading a difficult translation in cases like these. Despite taking a while to get into the language, I eventually quite enjoyed it.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>I enjoyed this quite a bit. It’s rather adventurous formally, presenting itself as a self-help book  with the goal of helping its reader achieve the titular goal of getting rich in the new Asia. The protagonist is the second person singular reader and the thematic chapters also trace the arc of that second person protagonist from birth through death in an unspecified, not-quite-Pakistan Asian country. The formal conceit may sound cute, but I found that it allowed Hamid to change frames from the intimately personal to the urban to the geopolitical freely. Having surrendered to the format quickly, I found it both touching and funny</p>

<title>Daniel Cook on ‘comfy games’</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>At a recent game designer retreat (Project Horseshoe) we had a working group trying to understand the psychology ‘comfy games’ like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or <em>Animal Crossing</em>. One thing we noticed is that many games focus on the bottom portion of Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs. They deal with survival, food, shelter and physical threats. Comfy games are instead comfortable spaces where you can work on some higher level human needs. You can dabble with self reflection, little social moments and maybe self expression. Games that treat players like higher order humans instead of twitchy, fear-based animals are a super cool thing!</p>

  <p>However, when a design introduces intense lower level needs, it can ruin the atmosphere that makes a comfy game work. <em>Pocket Camp</em> introduces time pressure and responsibility. If you don’t get that stupid sofa crafted before the animal leaves, you’ll miss a chance to progress along the checklist. Even when you do complete the task, it is entirely transactional. What would have been a mysterious quirky nuanced relationship in <em>Animal Crossing</em> is reduced to a meter incrementing so you can earn precious currency.  This is not an environment for self actualization. It is a place of rushed, time sensitive labor. Ugh.</p>

<title>Sass Variables in CSS calc() Functions</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>The most common use cases for variables in Sass allow you to drop variables directly into Sass stylesheets, so it’s easy to forget (or not to know in the first place) that there are certain circumstances where the interpolation syntax is necessary. The one I always forget is to use interpolation inside of CSS functions, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">calc()</code>.</p>

<p>The concept of ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation">interpolation</a>’ just refers to the replacement of a placeholder with its literal value, so really in the case of processing Sass to CSS almost all of your references to variables are probably setting up an interpolation. That’s what’s happening when <code class="highlighter-rouge">color: $alertColor;</code> in your Sass gets changed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">color: #f00;</code> in your CSS output.</p>

<p>There are instances, however, in which the Sass preprocessor will not perform this substitution unless you <em>explicitly</em> specify interpolation using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#{}</code> syntax. The <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#Interpolation_____">Sass documentation</a> explains that the interpolation syntax is necessary when using variables to construct selector and property names and may be used in property values except that it is only necessary in cases where operators next to it should be treated as plain CSS.</p>

<p>There is another case where the interpolation syntax is necessary, however, and it’s the one with which a recent (repeat) stumble inspired me to write up this note. Sass does not by default process the contents of CSS functions, so the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">min-height: calc($headerHeight - 2rem);</code> will be rendered to the CSS output with no change as <code class="highlighter-rouge">min-height: calc($headerHeight - 2rem);</code> (which is not valid CSS).</p>

<p>It is necessary to use interpolation explicitly to get the desire result in this case, so the correct line <code class="highlighter-rouge">min-height: calc(#{$headerHeight} - 2rem);</code> will produce CSS output such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">min-height: calc(50px - 2rem);</code> if the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">$headerHeight</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">50px</code>.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>Rob Gifford had been an NPR China correspondent for years when he decided to follow Route 312, the transcontinental highway that travels west and north from Shanghai all the way to the border with Uzbekistan, as his farewell to China. <em>China Road</em> is his travelogue organized both chronologically and geographically as he follows the road and thematically as the different people he encounters provide him opportunities to explore the capitalist awakening in China, political repression, internal migration, the colonial and imperial history of China in Tibet and the Uighur territories, the tension between the improved material circumstances of low-income Chinese and accelerating inequality of opportunity, and many other subjects. Written in 2007, it is a particularly interesting read with the benefit of a decade of hindsight on some of the potential trends he identifies.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p>A double-whodunit that wraps a more modern thriller set in the London publishing industry wrapped around a Agatha Christie-esque English countryside cozy mystery. I would not be surprised if there were a lot of genre-insider stuff that I missed, but I was nonetheless impressed by the technical challenge posed by the structure and Horowitz’s success in pulling it off.</p>

      </span>

        
          <span class="note"><p><em>Ring for Jeeves</em> has Jeeves on loan to the Earl of Rowcester while Bertie Wooster is away at a boarding school for young nobles to learn the basic life skills now necessary given the exigencies of the post-war welfare state. Rowcester’s own financial straits lead him to moonlight as a horse-racing bookmaker with Jeeves as his clerk. They are forced to welsh on a bet, and hilarity ensues through layers of escalating misunderstanding. Falls right in line with format and expectations, but fun stuff.</p>

          <span class="note"><p>This is the first installment in a Swedish series of police procedurals set in Göteborg and written in the 1990s. The whodunit aspects of it were compelling and well-executed and there was enough suggestion of the socially- and politically-aware themes that crime fiction is can be so well-suited to exploring that I intend to continue. It was particularly interesting to read 90s Scandinavian angst over misogyny and white nationalism as the social context for a detective story from a late 2017 U.S. perspective.</p>

<title>Explaining the Obvious</title>

<description>
    <![CDATA[
    <blockquote>
  <p>Be more explicit than you think is necessary, and you’ll nip misunderstandings in the bud. When everyone’s in the same room, it’s easier to notice an errant gesture that shows we’re not all on the same page. A remote team can only know what you say and type, so get everyone to agree that overexplaining won’t be taken as an insult. Don’t let it slip as the project goes on, either. “So what we’re saying is…” should be a common phrase throughout the life of the product.</p>
