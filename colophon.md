## Colophon

The bulk of this blog is rendered in [Effra](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/effra) from Dalton Maag. Fixed-width sequences and blocks are rendered in [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe/Source-Code-Pro) from Adobe.

I use a custom font built with [fontcustom](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom) to include a couple of icons next to special post types. Those icons are [Book](http://thenounproject.com/term/book/16194/) and [Post-It](http://thenounproject.com/term/post-it/16161/) from the [Icons By Hour](http://thenounproject.com/joe_harrison/collection/icons-by-hour/) collection by Joe Harrison, available from [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com) under the [Creative Commons-Attribution (CC BY 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.
