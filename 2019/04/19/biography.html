<p>My <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> journal tells me that I clipped this quotation four years ago today. I was doing a lot of reading in the middle of the night with a newborn child and a recently minted PhD and wondering what kind of writing I might be able to do outside of an academic context.</p>

<p>I still have no idea. Oops.</p>
