      content: "As part of my book project, I want to start becoming more familiar with the historigraphy on empire. This synthesis provides a global overview running two millennia—from ancient China and Rome to China and the United States in the 21st century—and contrasts the persistence of the empire as a form of state with its variability as a way of rule. As an overview, it is generally accessible and readable, and yet still includes the most recent interventions and revisions of contemporary scholarship. Among these include the decoupling of territoriality and imperial control, a focus on the layered forms of sovereignty on which empires relied (and which their subjects often forced upon them), and debunking the appearance of the nation-state as a natural evolution of the empire."
