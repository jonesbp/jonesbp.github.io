      content: "This continues to be one of my favorite current comics series, and this arc provides another new angle. Having covered interplanetary adventure and nuclear family dynamics, now thereâ€™s quotidian workplace ennui out in a world whose contours keep expanding beyond the initial binary conflict of the early issues."
