      content: "_Our America_ is a provocation that mocks North American myths regarding the WASP foundations of the United States and their supposed exceptional consequences. It also, however, neatly packages for a general audience the benefits of addressing the deep Iberian histories of not only the large swathes of the contintental US that were once part of the Spanish Empire and of Mexico, but of those regions typically understood to have only Anglophone legacies."
