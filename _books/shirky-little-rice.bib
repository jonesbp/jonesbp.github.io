      content: "Shirky lands on a take on Xiaomi that’s subtly different from any that I’ve heard before and makes them quite a bit more intriguing to me than I’d previously expected. Put simply, a focus on rapidly iterated software running on well-designed, but commodified, hardware sold online only has allowed Xiaomi to stake a claim to a segment of the smartphone market that doesn’t necessarily exist in the wealthier Western economies. Shirky makes a compelling case that it will, however, define the aspirational smartphone platform for the rising global middle class. I am increasingly wary of futurist predications about the liberating effects of consumer technology, but I think this Shirky’s picture of the next five or ten years is compelling."
