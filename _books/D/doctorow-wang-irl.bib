    content: "The plot is a bit of a corollary to Doctorow‘s young adult novel <i>For the Win</i> about teens who work in a massively multiplayer online game as gold farmers and organize against their real world bosses. <i>In Real Life</i> is about a young girl in Flagstaff who meets a teenage Chinese gold farmer in an online game and, in befriending him, learns both about his different experience and about the dangers inherent in her taking well-intentioned, if underinformed, actions on his behalf. The politics and moralism here are positive and are well-served by the story on a register that works for a teen audience. Jen Wang‘s artwork is great, particularly the beautiful coloring. I think it‘s too sophisticated for my nieces still, but I look forward to sharing it with them some day."
