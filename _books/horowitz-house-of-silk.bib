      content: "I haven’t read any of Horowitz’s other work, but I’ll definitely now at least read his other Holmes novel if not more. I was hesitant, but I think he’s actually captured the voice of the original very well, and the few contemporary updates—a lamentation from Watson that Mrs. Hudson gets such short shrift in his early work, for example—are both happily lighthanded and show an affection and understanding for the originals."
