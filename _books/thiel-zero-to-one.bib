      content: "Tech industry invocations of the history of science and technology are frequently frustratingly Whiggish and simplistic, and Thiel opens with the usual tropes of progress from the Scientific Revolution through Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. Knowing him primarily from equally simplistic public political pronouncements, I was neither surprised nor hopeful that things would improve. However, Thiel’s analysis of less grand problems, of problems on the scale of a single business, actually show precisely the kind of sensitivity to nuance and contingency that’s lacking in these other areas. I found the middle of this book to be a very insightful analysis of the relationships of people to business and of businesses to markets. The final chapter, a personality profile and psychological analysis of the ideal startup founder compiled from tech industry anecdotes, returns to pronouncements that are more grand than the insights they contain. In short, the silly parts are as silly as I feared—I will never get over the insistence on referring to a ‘startup’ as a historically unique mode of organizing people—but that middle part surprised me and is definitely worth the read."
