      content: "I am torn on my reaction to this book. On the one hand, I appreciate its engagement with world building and big-picture, strategic concerns. On the other hand, the strategic picture it paints frequently feels confused. I enjoyed the anti-colonial/anti-imperial thematics of it, but wished they were explored with more variety and detail. I enjoyed the willingness to be unflinching and brutal with the main characters in a way that makes sense in this world, but felt like it was frequently done in a lazily shocking way."
