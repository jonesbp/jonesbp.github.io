      content: "These ten short provocations about living online and in a digital age cover ethics and etiquette in roughly equal parts all to set up the core ‘command’ that to participate in this world with purpose one must understand the perspective gained from understanding programming. I find this conclusion—that everyone could benefit from the perspective gained from relatively short exposure to programming—a great corrective to the “Everyone must code!” evangelism. Given that the book was published in 2011, however, I wonder how much of just that brand of evangelism comes from a misunderstanding of the subtleties of Rushkoff’s argument. Regardless, the collection of questions about digital age ethics put me in a good frame of mind for approaching some of the post-dissertation projects I’ve been working on recently."
