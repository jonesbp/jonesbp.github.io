      content: "In this environmental history of Narragansett Bay, Pastore traces the development of the Bay from a nebulous and malleable estuary from the earliest arrivals of English settlers to its nineteenth-century incarnation as the coastal terminus of the inland industrial complex along the Blackwater Canal. The material on the early modern period provides a lot of material of historiographical interest for me in its discussion of how people construct marine and coastal spaces, and I hope to write a more detailed review focused on that material in the future. However, I find Pastore’s pitch for the contemporary importance of this estuarial history in an era of rising sea levels compelling as well. [A couple weeks ago](http://tinaja.computer/2015/02/15/weekly-reading.html) I mentioned Tim Maly’s essay on new approaches to designing the built environment of our coastlines, and Pastore ends up in a similar spot, arguing that our future relationship to the coastline may need to return to the flexible brackishness of the early modern Narragansett."
