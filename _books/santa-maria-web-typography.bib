      content: "I have read a lot about typography and have an interest in trying to use it well. I am frequently frustrated, however, to see things I make come together in a way I don’t like, but lack the pracitical vocabulary to articulate. Santa Maria’s book mostly operates at a high level; there are very few tips and tracks. However, that high level discussion is pervaded by examples in the form of asides on technical vocabulary and practical rules of thumb that provide just the kind of bridge between theory and practice that I have lacked to this point."
