      content: "One of the things that I enjoy most about crime fiction is its careful verisimilitude and the ability to speak to contemporary politics that results. Henning Mankell exemplifies this tendency among the Scandanavian detective fiction with which I’m familiar, and Richard Price is an obvious example of this tendency among American crime writers. Nesser sets his Inspector Van Veeteren series in a fictional Northern European no-place that removes this angle, but the detective story elements and an ambitious narrative structure more than make up for it. It’s been a long time since I’ve read detective fiction with as much interest in the unfolding of the mystery."
