      content: "I first read this book about 12 or 13 years ago for Jim Sidbury’s undegraduate historiography seminar at UT-Austin. I re-read it as a way to get further into the thinking about citations and concordances I’ve been doing recently. The structural conceit of investigating Ranke’s citations and antecedents as a way of challenging his claim to inventing modern professionalized historiography is a great example of the exploratory or discovery sensation provided by citation that I’d like to play with."
