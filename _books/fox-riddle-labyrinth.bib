      content: "Margalit Fox is the obituaries editor for the _New York Times_, and it seems clear to me that the marks of that occupation are all over this account. I was struck repeatedly by the different decisions she made than I would have as a historian; the relative freedom she had to be impressionistic with regard to chronology and causal relationships in order perhaps to reach a truer picture of individual. I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative and appreciated that she did not shy away from a serious, but accessible, engagement with some of the deciphering practices developed by her subjects."
