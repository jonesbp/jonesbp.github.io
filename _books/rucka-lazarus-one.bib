      content: "<i>Lazarus</i> sets up a near future in which a small handful of family-based corporations or cartels have taken over (at least) North America. It‘s a clear extrapolation of a world ruled by the 1% to a world ruled by the 0.1% with some biomechanical transhumanism and genetically modified agriculture thrown in. I love the world-building here. I care less about the characters and the story so far. I‘ve been really into other work I‘ve read from Rucka (<i>Gotham Central</i>, <i>Stumptown</i>), so I think I will probably continue with this, but I hope the next volume starts doing more with the promising setting."
