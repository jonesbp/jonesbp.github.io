      content: "The art in the couple of Francavilla issues was great; the art in the rest of the issues in the collection is not to my taste. Given Bendisâ€™s work in <i>Ultimate Spider-man</i> I honestly expected a bit more fun and a bit less straight-ahead comic book fighting and action. Not sure I need to read more."
