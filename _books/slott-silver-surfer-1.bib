      content: "I bought the first two issues of this new Silver Surfer book in hard-copy when it came out because Silver Surfer has always been one of my favorite characters and Dan Slott and Michael Allred are among my favorites in each of their respective crafts. I’ve only now been able to catch up and finish this arc by reading the first trade and it’s one of my favorites. The climax of the arc comes in 3 or 4 consecutive two page spreads that give Allred an opportunity for a real work out, and Slott throughout hits a great balance between hokey, knowing, and fun."
