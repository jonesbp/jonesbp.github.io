      content: "The family dynamics of the first collected volume of this book won me over, and they’re unfortunately not much in evidence in this arc. However, it’s still a lot of fun, and even though it’s more focused on typical super-hero-y action, the setting and thematic trappings of that action keep the same sense of humor and unique, light tone."
