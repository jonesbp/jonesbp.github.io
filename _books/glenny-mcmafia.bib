      content: "Glenny has a dry wit, even at times when dealing with some pretty bleak material. He sets out to explain the globalized generation of organized crime, framing his chronology between the collapse of the Soviet Union and Chinaâ€™s ascendance on the global stage. Fascinating details and anecdotes, but also a compelling argument for the role of the misguided international policing, trade, and military policies in incubating these criminal organizations."
