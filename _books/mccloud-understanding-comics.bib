      content: "I’ve been thinking a lot recently about how to present textual, but not long-form prose, content in space in interesting and useful ways for some new projects. (I’ve also started reading quite a few more comics in the last year than I ever have before.) McCloud uses the comics form here to explore the theory and mechanics of comics in way that introduced ways of seeing that I’d never considered, but that also provided useful vocabulary for articulating more intuitive impressions of the form I already carried, but struggled to express. Definitely a worthwhile read for people who enjoy comics or looking for new angles for thinking about page layout, interface design, or other areas of information design."
