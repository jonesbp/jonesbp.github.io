      content: "Hiatt suggests that two traditional thematic approaches to the antipodes—as part of ancient history and as part of the history of discoveries—and a tripartite periodization—ancient/medieval, Age of Discovery, and eighteenth/nineteenth century surveying—have dominated treatments of the Antipodes in cartographic history and historigraphical geography. In this book he traces the development of Antipodean representation through European history as a whole. Collapsing the boundaries between these buckets provides useful insights for the complex, evolving, and multivalent ways that the Antipodes, and unknown spaces in general, influenced European cosmographies and epistemologies."
