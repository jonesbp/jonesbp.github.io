      content: "I had seen a lot of praise for Parkin’s book when it first came out, but didn’t know what to expect. It’s a hodgepodge, in a good way, of miniature essays, reviews, and reportage on games taken from a wide swathe of creative and commercial spectrum, collected into twelve chapters exploring different emotional roles and consequences video games fulfill and create. The pieces that relied more on reportage than criticism were the most interesting for me, because there were new stories there where the critical voice is very much in line with a developing consensus. That said, for those unfamiliar with that voice, this represents a great, thoroughgoing gateway into thinking about video games from a new, critical perspective."
