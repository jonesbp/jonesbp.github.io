      content: "I came to this through an [interview](http://www.fsgoriginals.com/detail/in-conversation-j.-m.-ledgard-robin-sloan) with Ledgard by Robin Sloan. I think it’s clear that what appealed to Sloan in this work is what appeals to me about Sloan’s: the ability to work in the registers of the material and the virtual, the mundane and the futurist at the same time. Ledgard’s weaves networks of burrows and roads; roads and airplanes; and airplanes drones from a story that starts with a walk through the bush and ends with a prediction of on-demand delivery of staple goods and consumer comforts to previously unconnected communties. One of the first techno-futurist-style ruminations I’ve encountered in a while that feels like it has its heart in the right place."
