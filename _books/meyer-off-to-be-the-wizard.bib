      content: "I picked this up as an easy read having seen [Glenn Fleishman](https://twitter.com/glennf) recommend it on Twitter a few weeks ago. Having independently discovered that reality is only a computer simulation to which they have access to the main configuration repository, a collection of geeks find they’ve all had the idea to time travel to medieval England and pose as magicians with their new powers. For my tastes, the light humor element could have been less prominent in favor working through the consequences of the central conceit in more detail, but it was fun, easy, and great for picking up at odd hours with a newborn in the house. This is also the first book I’ve bought on one of Amazon’s inhouse imprints, and I was impressed by the presentation. I imagine I’ll eventually pick up the next one in the Magic 2.0 series."
