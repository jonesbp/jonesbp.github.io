      content: "Seth Godin writes in the sort of breathless self-help style that I always have a difficult time slogging through, but there are always some insightful approaches to new ideas hanging around in the gung ho attitude. Iâ€™m glad to have read this while pulling together the initial pieces of a new project, but it was definitely the sort of reading that is more about creating a certain short-term frame of mind than in collecting new long-term insights to carry with me."
