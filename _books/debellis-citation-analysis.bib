      content: "Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about citations in history writing recently because of a new project. This history of the development of citation analysis techniques in the sciences was actually surprisingly engaging and readable. A great introduction to thinking some of the basic theoretical questions information scientists consider in working when analyzing citations and other (potential) markers of intellectual community."
