      content: "Read this (and immediately recommended it to Chris) when we were starting up [The Appendix](http://theappendix.net) when the book came out a few years ago. I love the balanced affection for books and digital technology and their crossovers as well as the expression of friendship through collaborative partnership in work and creativity. Read it again this week as a new project with some Appendicistas gets under way."
