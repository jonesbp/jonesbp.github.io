      content: "Discovered this afternoon-in-the-life-of-a-hitman short story as a Kindle single while reading through [Robin Sloan’s Amazon.com reviews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3HNIW1RUR6JIK). I agree with Sloan’s take that it’s a wonderful bit of LA writing. It’s also enjoyably brutal, repulsive, and readable."
