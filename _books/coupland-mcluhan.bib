      content: "All of the elements of Coupland’s work that I appreciate—the juxtaposition of technical jargon and humane empathy, non-linear experimentation, obsession with systems—are here. These formal and thematic traits also happen to make his approach to the medium of the biography a great match for McLuhan’s work. While he clearly feels an intellectual and personal sympathy with McLuhan, there is also critical analysis of the effects of his work. Having been planning on finally reading more than excerpts of McLuhan myself, this was a great way to whet my appetite."
