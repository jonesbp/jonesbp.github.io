      content: "A collaborative essay on the historical role of the humanities, of the role of digital and computational perspectives and techniques in the humanities, and of the social dynamics of intellectual labor in a networked world. Also includes a series of provocations to future scholars who might consider themselves “digital humanists.” Includes some helpful hypothetical case studies that explore more concrete considerations for developing a consensus on ‘best practices.’"
