    content: "Carter develops a ‘spatial history’ of Australia from the arrival to and naming of the continent by European navigators to contemporary debates on telling Aborigine history both in connection to Australian and on its own terms. Spatial history for Carter is a tool that counteracts imperial history; understanding the role of the environment in shaping human behavior subverts imperial narratives that treat the landscape as a simple stage set for the founding of the nation. For my purposes, Carter’s work with toponyms and movement are the most helpful, but his more general political argument regarding the potential for a spatial approach to history to allow for a more inclusive approach to the several Australian histories is compelling."
