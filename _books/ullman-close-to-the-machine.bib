      content: "<i>Close to the Machine</i> is the kind of book about computers that appears reverently in the words of many of my favorite writers who write about computers, and seemingly nowhere else. It’s a great document of what being engaged with computers and the online world felt like in the pre-bubble mid-90s, resonating with me even though I was still only in my teens. More universally, it is the best exploration of the worldview that experience with computer programming engenders and of the tensions inherent in being passionate for the possibilities of a medium so innately tied to unappealing corporate and material realities. I recently read Douglas Rushkoff’s <i>Program or Be Programmed</i> in which he makes the rhetorical case for programming literacy and its epistemological benefits; Ullman’s memoir provides the emotional case."
