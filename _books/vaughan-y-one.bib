      content: "I’m glad to be encountering these only now that they’ve been collected in these large 11 or 12 issue volumes. I can tell that it is the world-building here that will keep me into this, and I only got there in the last bits of this volume. If I had picked up a 5 issue length trade, I’m not sure I would have understood what the fuss was about."
