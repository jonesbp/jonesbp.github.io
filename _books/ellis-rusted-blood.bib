      content: "A short detective story in an interesting near future urban fantasy world. Ellis published it as a Kindle Single in an almost off-the-cuff fashion last fall and suggests that it will be the first of a series, one story for each of the boroughs of the city of Elektrograd. I look forward to reading more of them."
