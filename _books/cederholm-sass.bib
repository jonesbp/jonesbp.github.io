      content: "Having used Sass in practice for years, the introductory nature of most of this was familiar review. Having only learned by doing, however, it was nice to confirm I wasn’t missing any essential basic tools or features. That said, Cederholm’s techniques for using Sass with media queries are far beyond what I’ve been doing and I will start employing them immediately."
