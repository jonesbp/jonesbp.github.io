      content: "Touati investigates the travel writing tradition in Islam primarily from the eighth through tenth centuries, with a nod to later writers such as Ibn Battuta. His jumping off point is a contrast with later European travelers for whom exotic sights beyond their own cultural sphere motivated their travel and for whom the trip itself may have simply been a means to the end of having an opportunity to write about the experience. Touati argues that for Muslim travelers writing about what they saw was not so immediate a reflex and that their interest in travel lay almost exclusively within the bounds of the Islamic world. Immediately useful as a reminder that “travel writing” as it is commonly imagined in Western historiography is a historically and culturally determined phenomenon. Also potentially useful in tracing late Greek geography through the Middle Ages into the fifteenth and sixteenth century re-engagement with Ptolemy et al."
