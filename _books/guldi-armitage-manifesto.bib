      content: "This short experiment in open-access publishing presents a provocative invitation to historians to use the analytical tools of the digital humanities to re-open <i>longue dur√©e</i> perspectives. The tone is polemical and, as with any polemic, the presentation of historiographical trends is more simplified and argumentative than it is comprehensive and nuanced. There has been a good deal of recent pushback against the work (that I have not yet read, but plan to), and I imagine that at least some of the hullaballoo results from this aspect of the book. I can say, however, that as an undergraduate in the late 90s and early aughts and a graduate student in the late aughts and early teens, the historiographical, pedagaogical, and methodological tropes challenged here are at least anecdotally familiar to me and reflect some of my frustrations as a student. I am happy to accept the polemic its own terms in that sense."
