      content: "Ultimately as a monograph this was a disappointing and repetitive read. Faganâ€™s synthesis of archaeological studies of medieval European fish farming and North Sea, Baltic, and North Atlantic fisheries serves as a helpful entrypoint for further reading, but the historical narrative here is thin and repetitive. Feels like what could have been a handful of interesting academic articles instead chasing a sexy title for general readers, but without delivering."
