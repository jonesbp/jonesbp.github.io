      content: "I bought this after hearing [John Seabrook’s episode](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-162-john-seabrook) of the Longform podcast. Framing himself as an outsider (a ‘rock guy’ and a father) trying to develop an appreciation of his children’s popular music. , Seabrook writes a history of the contemporary ‘track and hook’ pop song from Ace of Base to Ke$ha, particularly by tracing the influence of Swedish pop producers Denniz Pop and Max Martin. Along the way, he dips into some rock-doc-style music industry gossip, business analysis, and light music theory."
