      content: "The whole <a href='http://objectsobjectsobjects.com'>Object Lessons</a> series has intrigued me since it was first announced. Both the organizing conceit of aesthetic essays on mundane objects and the approach to the books themselves as objects—the cover designs, the format, etc.—were appealing to me. Rothstein’s <i>Drone</i> is the first of the series I’ve read. I am impressed by the light touch with which he brings contemporary Science and Technology Studies perspectives into a very readable exploration of the role of unmanned aircraft in our culture. I wonder if the drone really is the paradigmatic visual technology of our time. I don’t dispute the notion that the disembodied perspective from above is characteristic. (I spend far too much time revisiting old neighborhoods with Google Earth mapping not to relate to that argument.) It seems that more people experience this perspective through satellite imagery. I suspect the answer is that were are approaching a transition where the increased flexibility and availability of drones over satellites will mark a transition in this regard."
