      content: "Fingerman’s slice of life approach does a good job of capturing that late-twenties phase of managing both to be unconcerned about wasting time in the present and overwhelmingly concerned about what might come of the future at the same time. There’s an out of time quality that reminds of me of Linklater’s _Slacker_. I like the people in _Slacker_ a lot more. I guess it’s no surprise that in this phase of my life I was an Austin guy and not a New York guy."
