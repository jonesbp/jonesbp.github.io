      content: "As part of my book project, I want to start becoming more familiar with the historigraphy on empire. This synthesis provides a global overview running two millennia—from ancient China and Rome to China and the United States in the 21st century—and contrasts the persistence of the empire as a form of state with its variability as a way of rule. As an overview, it is generally accessible and readable, and yet still includes the most recent interventions and revisions of contemporary scholarship. Among these include the decoupling of territoriality and imperial control, a focus on the layered forms of sovereignty on which empires relied (and which their subjects often forced upon them), and debunking the appearance of the nation-state as a natural evolution of the empire."

      content: "A lot of the coverage this book has received in the tech press has focused on Mayer’s social idiosyncrasies and how they have damaged her ability to relate to and to lead the people she works with. The book’s three part structure, however—outlining the serial struggles of several pre-Mayer Yahoo! CEOs, Mayer’s success at Google, and Mayer’s struggles at Yahoo!—drives home Carlson’s doubt that it may be possible for anyone to succeed at Yahoo!. Carlson asks whether Yahoo! was simply the product of a specific, and now past, historical moment. Also of interest, but underdeveloped, was Carlson’s insight that Mayer’s hiring problems have her trying to do the work of a ‘media’ executive when she is a ‘product’ person. Reading this at the same time as Paul Ford on ‘[product](https://medium.com/message/its-kind-of-cheesy-being-green-2c72cc9e5eda)’ at [_The Message_](https://medium.com/message) this week added both some weight and some skepticism to that distinction."
