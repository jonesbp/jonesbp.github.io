      content: "As part of my book project, I want to start becoming more familiar with the historigraphy on empire. This synthesis provides a global overview running two millennia—from ancient China and Rome to China and the United States in the 21st century—and contrasts the persistence of the empire as a form of state with its variability as a way of rule. As an overview, it is generally accessible and readable, and yet still includes the most recent interventions and revisions of contemporary scholarship. Among these include the decoupling of territoriality and imperial control, a focus on the layered forms of sovereignty on which empires relied (and which their subjects often forced upon them), and debunking the appearance of the nation-state as a natural evolution of the empire."

Also includes a series of provocations to future scholars who might consider themselves “digital humanists.” Includes some helpful hypothetical case studies that explore more concrete considerations for developing a consensus on ‘best practices.’"

      content: "A lot of the coverage this book has received in the tech press has focused on Mayer’s social idiosyncrasies and how they have damaged her ability to relate to and to lead the people she works with. The book’s three part structure, however—outlining the serial struggles of several pre-Mayer Yahoo! CEOs, Mayer’s success at Google, and Mayer’s struggles at Yahoo!—drives home Carlson’s doubt that it may be possible for anyone to succeed at Yahoo!. Carlson asks whether Yahoo! was simply the product of a specific, and now past, historical moment. Also of interest, but underdeveloped, was Carlson’s insight that Mayer’s hiring problems have her trying to do the work of a ‘media’ executive when she is a ‘product’ person. Reading this at the same time as Paul Ford on ‘[product](https://medium.com/message/its-kind-of-cheesy-being-green-2c72cc9e5eda)’ at [_The Message_](https://medium.com/message) this week added both some weight and some skepticism to that distinction."

      content: "Encountering the optimistic argument towards the end of this book regarding the positive prospects for Iraq once it returns to more normal circumstances is rather poignant in a 2015 dominated by news of ISIS. This is precisely the sort of historical contingency that makes historians leery of overly schematic and predictive arguments regarding human behavior. Nonetheless, the authors’ irreverent stance towards the conventional wisdom of the footballing world and their rigorous analysis of English soccer make intriguing reading. That history from outside sport intervenes should not devalue the sports-related consequences of their analysis."

There’s an out of time quality that reminds of me of Linklater’s _Slacker_. I like the people in _Slacker_ a lot more. I guess it’s no surprise that in this phase of my life I was an Austin guy and not a New York guy."

      content: "In this environmental history of Narragansett Bay, Pastore traces the development of the Bay from a nebulous and malleable estuary from the earliest arrivals of English settlers to its nineteenth-century incarnation as the coastal terminus of the inland industrial complex along the Blackwater Canal. The material on the early modern period provides a lot of material of historiographical interest for me in its discussion of how people construct marine and coastal spaces, and I hope to write a more detailed review focused on that material in the future. However, I find Pastore’s pitch for the contemporary importance of this estuarial history in an era of rising sea levels compelling as well. [A couple weeks ago](http://tinaja.computer/2015/02/15/weekly-reading.html) I mentioned Tim Maly’s essay on new approaches to designing the built environment of our coastlines, and Pastore ends up in a similar spot, arguing that our future relationship to the coastline may need to return to the flexible brackishness of the early modern Narragansett."

      content: "Tech industry invocations of the history of science and technology are frequently frustratingly Whiggish and simplistic, and Thiel opens with the usual tropes of progress from the Scientific Revolution through Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. Knowing him primarily from equally simplistic public political pronouncements, I was neither surprised nor hopeful that things would improve. However, Thiel’s analysis of less grand problems, of problems on the scale of a single business, actually show precisely the kind of sensitivity to nuance and contingency that’s lacking in these other areas. I found the middle of this book to be a very insightful analysis of the relationships of people to business and of businesses to markets. The final chapter, a personality profile and psychological analysis of the ideal startup founder compiled from tech industry anecdotes, returns to pronouncements that are more grand than the insights they contain. In short, the silly parts are as silly as I feared—I will never get over the insistence on referring to a ‘startup’ as a historically unique mode of organizing people—but that middle part surprised me and is definitely worth the read."

Feels like what could have been a handful of interesting academic articles instead chasing a sexy title for general readers, but without delivering."

McCloud uses the comics form here to explore the theory and mechanics of comics in way that introduced ways of seeing that I’d never considered, but that also provided useful vocabulary for articulating more intuitive impressions of the form I already carried, but struggled to express. Definitely a worthwhile read for people who enjoy comics or looking for new angles for thinking about page layout, interface design, or other areas of information design."

Having independently discovered that reality is only a computer simulation to which they have access to the main configuration repository, a collection of geeks find they’ve all had the idea to time travel to medieval England and pose as magicians with their new powers. For my tastes, the light humor element could have been less prominent in favor working through the consequences of the central conceit in more detail, but it was fun, easy, and great for picking up at odd hours with a newborn in the house. This is also the first book I’ve bought on one of Amazon’s inhouse imprints, and I was impressed by the presentation. I imagine I’ll eventually pick up the next one in the Magic 2.0 series."

I find this conclusion—that everyone could benefit from the perspective gained from relatively short exposure to programming—a great corrective to the “Everyone must code!” evangelism. Given that the book was published in 2011, however, I wonder how much of just that brand of evangelism comes from a misunderstanding of the subtleties of Rushkoff’s argument. Regardless, the collection of questions about digital age ethics put me in a good frame of mind for approaching some of the post-dissertation projects I’ve been working on recently."

Not so much time travel, these shifts are both involuntary and predictable, like a <i>Groundhog Day</i> that lasts forty years. Those familiar with Pollack‘s non-fiction work will recognize some (not always flattering) character traits in the protagonist in spite of the fact that Pollack appears as himself in at least one of life‘s playthroughs. That Pollack both writes himself into and distances himself from his character reflects my own experience of the novel. As a new father, the ultimately sweet and heartwarming conclusion landed with me, but the sardonic humor helped me keep my distance on the way there."

The politics and moralism here are positive and are well-served by the story on a register that works for a teen audience. Jen Wang‘s artwork is great, particularly the beautiful coloring. I think it‘s too sophisticated for my nieces still, but I look forward to sharing it with them some day."

I love the world-building here. I care less about the characters and the story so far. I‘ve been really into other work I‘ve read from Rucka (<i>Gotham Central</i>, <i>Stumptown</i>), so I think I will probably continue with this, but I hope the next volume starts doing more with the promising setting."

It’s a great document of what being engaged with computers and the online world felt like in the pre-bubble mid-90s, resonating with me even though I was still only in my teens. More universally, it is the best exploration of the worldview that experience with computer programming engenders and of the tensions inherent in being passionate for the possibilities of a medium so innately tied to unappealing corporate and material realities. I recently read Douglas Rushkoff’s <i>Program or Be Programmed</i> in which he makes the rhetorical case for programming literacy and its epistemological benefits; Ullman’s memoir provides the emotional case."
