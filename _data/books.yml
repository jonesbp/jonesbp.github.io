      content: "As part of my book project, I want to start becoming more familiar with the historigraphy on empire. This synthesis provides a global overview running two millennia—from ancient China and Rome to China and the United States in the 21st century—and contrasts the persistence of the empire as a form of state with its variability as a way of rule. As an overview, it is generally accessible and readable, and yet still includes the most recent interventions and revisions of contemporary scholarship. Among these include the decoupling of territoriality and imperial control, a focus on the layered forms of sovereignty on which empires relied (and which their subjects often forced upon them), and debunking the appearance of the nation-state as a natural evolution of the empire."

      content: "A collaborative essay on the historical role of the humanities, of the role of digital and computational perspectives and techniques in the humanities, and of the social dynamics of intellectual labor in a networked world. Also includes a series of provocations to future scholars who might consider themselves “digital humanists.” Includes some helpful hypothetical case studies that explore more concrete considerations for developing a consensus on ‘best practices.’"
