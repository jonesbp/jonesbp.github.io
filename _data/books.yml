      content: "As part of my book project, I want to start becoming more familiar with the historigraphy on empire. This synthesis provides a global overview running two millennia—from ancient China and Rome to China and the United States in the 21st century—and contrasts the persistence of the empire as a form of state with its variability as a way of rule. As an overview, it is generally accessible and readable, and yet still includes the most recent interventions and revisions of contemporary scholarship. Among these include the decoupling of territoriality and imperial control, a focus on the layered forms of sovereignty on which empires relied (and which their subjects often forced upon them), and debunking the appearance of the nation-state as a natural evolution of the empire."

      content: "A lot of the coverage this book has received in the tech press has focused on Mayer’s social idiosyncrasies and how they have damaged her ability to relate to and to lead the people she works with. The book’s three part structure, however—outlining the serial struggles of several pre-Mayer Yahoo! CEOs, Mayer’s success at Google, and Mayer’s struggles at Yahoo!—drives home Carlson’s doubt that it may be possible for anyone to succeed at Yahoo!. Carlson asks whether Yahoo! was simply the product of a specific, and now past, historical moment. Also of interest, but underdeveloped, was Carlson’s insight that Mayer’s hiring problems have her trying to do the work of a ‘media’ executive when she is a ‘product’ person. Reading this at the same time as Paul Ford on ‘[product](https://medium.com/message/its-kind-of-cheesy-being-green-2c72cc9e5eda)’ at [_The Message_](https://medium.com/message) this week added both some weight and some skepticism to that distinction."

This is precisely the sort of historical contingency that makes historians leery of overly schematic and predictive arguments regarding human behavior. Nonetheless, the authors’ irreverent stance towards the conventional wisdom of the footballing world and their rigorous analysis of English soccer make intriguing reading. That history from outside sport intervenes should not devalue the sports-related consequences of their analysis."

The material on the early modern period provides a lot of material of historiographical interest for me in its discussion of how people construct marine and coastal spaces, and I hope to write a more detailed review focused on that material in the future. However, I find Pastore’s pitch for the contemporary importance of this estuarial history in an era of rising sea levels compelling as well. [A couple weeks ago](http://tinaja.computer/2015/02/15/weekly-reading.html) I mentioned Tim Maly’s essay on new approaches to designing the built environment of our coastlines, and Pastore ends up in a similar spot, arguing that our future relationship to the coastline may need to return to the flexible brackishness of the early modern Narragansett."

Knowing him primarily from equally simplistic public political pronouncements, I was neither surprised nor hopeful that things would improve. However, Thiel’s analysis of less grand problems, of problems on the scale of a single business, actually show precisely the kind of sensitivity to nuance and contingency that’s lacking in these other areas. I found the middle of this book to be a very insightful analysis of the relationships of people to business and of businesses to markets. The final chapter, a personality profile and psychological analysis of the ideal startup founder compiled from tech industry anecdotes, returns to pronouncements that are more grand than the insights they contain. In short, the silly parts are as silly as I feared—I will never get over the insistence on referring to a ‘startup’ as a historically unique mode of organizing people—but that middle part surprised me and is definitely worth the read."

For my tastes, the light humor element could have been less prominent in favor working through the consequences of the central conceit in more detail, but it was fun, easy, and great for picking up at odd hours with a newborn in the house.

I find this conclusion—that everyone could benefit from the perspective gained from relatively short exposure to programming—a great corrective to the “Everyone must code!” evangelism. Given that the book was published in 2011, however, I wonder how much of just that brand of evangelism comes from a misunderstanding of the subtleties of Rushkoff’s argument. Regardless, the collection of questions about digital age ethics put me in a good frame of mind for approaching some of the post-dissertation projects I’ve been working on recently."

Not so much time travel, these shifts are both involuntary and predictable, like a <i>Groundhog Day</i> that lasts forty years. Those familiar with Pollack‘s non-fiction work will recognize some (not always flattering) character traits in the protagonist in spite of the fact that Pollack appears as himself in at least one of life‘s playthroughs. That Pollack both writes himself into and distances himself from his character reflects my own experience of the novel. As a new father, the ultimately sweet and heartwarming conclusion landed with me, but the sardonic humor helped me keep my distance on the way there."

The politics and moralism here are positive and are well-served by the story on a register that works for a teen audience. Jen Wang‘s artwork is great, particularly the beautiful coloring.

More universally, it is the best exploration of the worldview that experience with computer programming engenders and of the tensions inherent in being passionate for the possibilities of a medium so innately tied to unappealing corporate and material realities. I recently read Douglas Rushkoff’s <i>Program or Be Programmed</i> in which he makes the rhetorical case for programming literacy and its epistemological benefits; Ullman’s memoir provides the emotional case."

The tone is polemical and, as with any polemic, the presentation of historiographical trends is more simplified and argumentative than it is comprehensive and nuanced. There has been a good deal of recent pushback against the work (that I have not yet read, but plan to), and I imagine that at least some of the hullaballoo results from this aspect of the book. I can say, however, that as an undergraduate in the late 90s and early aughts and a graduate student in the late aughts and early teens, the historiographical, pedagaogical, and methodological tropes challenged here are at least anecdotally familiar to me and reflect some of my frustrations as a student. I am happy to accept the polemic its own terms in that sense."

Rothstein’s <i>Drone</i> is the first of the series I’ve read. I am impressed by the light touch with which he brings contemporary Science and Technology Studies perspectives into a very readable exploration of the role of unmanned aircraft in our culture. I wonder if the drone really is the paradigmatic visual technology of our time. I don’t dispute the notion that the disembodied perspective from above is characteristic. (I spend far too much time revisiting old neighborhoods with Google Earth mapping not to relate to that argument.) It seems that more people experience this perspective through satellite imagery. I suspect the answer is that were are approaching a transition where the increased flexibility and availability of drones over satellites will mark a transition in this regard."

My favorite covered the changing design biases over Apple history from the Apple ][ as a tinkerer’s machine to the hermetically sealed consumer objects of today. Bogost’s sensitivity to the marketing, documentation, and material design of the products in addition to their technical capabilities made this not-new-to-him argument for more compelling than those I’ve seen from Jeff Atwood or Cory Doctorow. The quickly-produced e-book with cheap print option format of this University of Minnesota Press series was also intriguing. I’m curious to check out other titles."

He sets out to explain the globalized generation of organized crime, framing his chronology between the collapse of the Soviet Union and China’s ascendance on the global stage. Fascinating details and anecdotes, but also a compelling argument for the role of the misguided international policing, trade, and military policies in incubating these criminal organizations."

This history of the development of citation analysis techniques in the sciences was actually surprisingly engaging and readable. A great introduction to thinking some of the basic theoretical questions information scientists consider in working when analyzing citations and other (potential) markers of intellectual community."

I re-read it as a way to get further into the thinking about citations and concordances I’ve been doing recently. The structural conceit of investigating Ranke’s citations and antecedents as a way of challenging his claim to inventing modern professionalized historiography is a great example of the exploratory or discovery sensation provided by citation that I’d like to play with."

      content: "This enormous global history of the seventeenth century both seeks to verify the epochal understanding of the century has a time of Great Crisis and investigates the connection of the widespread social upheaval to climate change during the Little Ice Age. As global history, it is impressively comprehensive while still showing the difficulties inherent to a global-scale project. England and Spain figure prominently—which is not surprising given Parker’s background—but India, China, Persia, and Japan all receive treatment on par with European states other than Spain and England. The Americas, Africa, and Australia play less of a role, but Parker acknowledges the lacuna and asserts the absence of archival and climatological data as its cause. The argument itself—the role of the Little Ice Age in generating social upheaval—is compelling, and the work seems to be a good model of the possibilities of using climatological data in a readable synthesis."

Henning Mankell exemplifies this tendency among the Scandanavian detective fiction with which I’m familiar, and Richard Price is an obvious example of this tendency among American crime writers. Nesser sets his Inspector Van Veeteren series in a fictional Northern European no-place that removes this angle, but the detective story elements and an ambitious narrative structure more than make up for it. It’s been a long time since I’ve read detective fiction with as much interest in the unfolding of the mystery."

The climax of the arc comes in 3 or 4 consecutive two page spreads that give Allred an opportunity for a real work out, and Slott throughout hits a great balance between hokey, knowing, and fun."

I am frequently frustrated, however, to see things I make come together in a way I don’t like, but lack the pracitical vocabulary to articulate. Santa Maria’s book mostly operates at a high level; there are very few tips and tracks. However, that high level discussion is pervaded by examples in the form of asides on technical vocabulary and practical rules of thumb that provide just the kind of bridge between theory and practice that I have lacked to this point."

I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative and appreciated that she did not shy away from a serious, but accessible, engagement with some of the deciphering practices developed by her subjects."

I think it’s clear that what appealed to Sloan in this work is what appeals to me about Sloan’s: the ability to work in the registers of the material and the virtual, the mundane and the futurist at the same time. Ledgard’s weaves networks of burrows and roads; roads and airplanes; and airplanes drones from a story that starts with a walk through the bush and ends with a prediction of on-demand delivery of staple goods and consumer comforts to previously unconnected communties. One of the first techno-futurist-style ruminations I’ve encountered in a while that feels like it has its heart in the right place."

      content: "Silverblatt’s takes Hannah Arendt’s work on the fusion of modern racism and bureaucracy at the foundation of Nazi Germany as the point of departure for her exploration of ‘race thinking’ in colonial Peru. Arendt, as is typical of most discussions of colonialism and imperialism, cites the nineteenth-century French and British examples as the peculiarly modern inspirations for twentieth century. Silverblatt, however, presents the Inquisition as an inherently modern institution, both in the complexity of its bureaucratic logistics and in its racialized logics, that predates these examples by several centuries. At first glance, this stance might be understood as one more refutation of the Black Legend; however, revisionist responses to that old trope are most frequently concerned with refurbishing the Spanish image. The conseequences of Silverblatt’s argument go deeper. The sophistication of the Inquisition’s bureaucratic apparatus was an impressive accomplishment not often associated with standard histories of the Spanish empire, sure, and Anglophone North Americans should have a more thorough awareness of the Hispanic legacies of their continent. Beyond that, though, the racial dynamics that organized the Inquisition in Peru demonstrates how thoroughly race thinking and white supremacy have ordered American societies from the very beginning of the modern state."

    content: "I had seen a lot of praise for Parkin’s book when it first came out, but didn’t know what to expect. It’s a hodgepodge, in a good way, of miniature essays, reviews, and reportage on games taken from a wide swathe of creative and commercial spectrum, collected into twelve chapters exploring different emotional roles and consequences video games fulfill and create. The pieces that relied more on reportage than criticism were the most interesting for me, because there were new stories there where the critical voice is very much in line with a developing consensus. That said, for those unfamiliar with that voice, this represents a great, thoroughgoing gateway into thinking about video games from a new, critical perspective."

    content: "Shirky lands on a take on Xiaomi that’s subtly different from any that I’ve heard before and makes them quite a bit more intriguing to me than I’d previously expected. Put simply, a focus on rapidly iterated software running on well-designed, but commodified, hardware sold online only has allowed Xiaomi to stake a claim to a segment of the smartphone market that doesn’t necessarily exist in the wealthier Western economies. Shirky makes a compelling case that it will, however, define the aspirational smartphone platform for the rising global middle class. I am increasingly wary of futurist predications about the liberating effects of consumer technology, but I think this Shirky’s picture of the next five or ten years is compelling."
