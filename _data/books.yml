      content: "As part of my book project, I want to start becoming more familiar with the historigraphy on empire. This synthesis provides a global overview running two millennia—from ancient China and Rome to China and the United States in the 21st century—and contrasts the persistence of the empire as a form of state with its variability as a way of rule. As an overview, it is generally accessible and readable, and yet still includes the most recent interventions and revisions of contemporary scholarship. Among these include the decoupling of territoriality and imperial control, a focus on the layered forms of sovereignty on which empires relied (and which their subjects often forced upon them), and debunking the appearance of the nation-state as a natural evolution of the empire."

      content: "A collaborative essay on the historical role of the humanities, of the role of digital and computational perspectives and techniques in the humanities, and of the social dynamics of intellectual labor in a networked world. Also includes a series of provocations to future scholars who might consider themselves “digital humanists.” Includes some helpful hypothetical case studies that explore more concrete considerations for developing a consensus on ‘best practices.’"

      content: "A lot of the coverage this book has received in the tech press has focused on Mayer’s social idiosyncrasies and how they have damaged her ability to relate to and to lead the people she works with. The book’s three part structure, however—outlining the serial struggles of several pre-Mayer Yahoo! CEOs, Mayer’s success at Google, and Mayer’s struggles at Yahoo!—drives home Carlson’s doubt that it may be possible for anyone to succeed at Yahoo!. Carlson asks whether Yahoo! was simply the product of a specific, and now past, historical moment. Also of interest, but underdeveloped, was Carlson’s insight that Mayer’s hiring problems have her trying to do the work of a ‘media’ executive when she is a ‘product’ person. Reading this at the same time as Paul Ford on ‘[product](https://medium.com/message/its-kind-of-cheesy-being-green-2c72cc9e5eda)’ at [_The Message_](https://medium.com/message) this week added both some weight and some skepticism to that distinction."

      content: "_Our America_ is a provocation that mocks North American myths regarding the WASP foundations of the United States and their supposed exceptional consequences. It also, however, neatly packages for a general audience the benefits of addressing the deep Iberian histories of not only the large swathes of the contintental US that were once part of the Spanish Empire and of Mexico, but of those regions typically understood to have only Anglophone legacies."

      content: "Encountering the optimistic argument towards the end of this book regarding the positive prospects for Iraq once it returns to more normal circumstances is rather poignant in a 2015 dominated by news of ISIS. This is precisely the sort of historical contingency that makes historians leery of overly schematic and predictive arguments regarding human behavior. Nonetheless, the authors’ irreverent stance towards the conventional wisdom of the footballing world and their rigorous analysis of English soccer make intriguing reading. That history from outside sport intervenes should not devalue the sports-related consequences of their analysis."

      content: "Fingerman’s slice of life approach does a good job of capturing that late-twenties phase of managing both to be unconcerned about wasting time in the present and overwhelmingly concerned about what might come of the future at the same time. There’s an out of time quality that reminds of me of Linklater’s _Slacker_. I like the people in _Slacker_ a lot more. I guess it’s no surprise that in this phase of my life I was an Austin guy and not a New York guy."
