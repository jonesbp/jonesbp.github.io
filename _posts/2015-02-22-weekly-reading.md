- **[Open Notebook History](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html):** W. Caleb McDaniel writes about his motivations for experimenting with keeping an open research notebook on his upcoming project. I have been thinking along similar lines with my work turning my dissertation project into a book. The risks and anxieties McDaniel outlines—making mistakes in public, being scooped, etc.—are what has kept me from doing so so far, but I’m going to give it more thought based on his notes.
- **[Is it time for password-less login?](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login):** (plus [follow-up](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/28288684632/more-on-password-less-login)) I’ve been working on a new app recently and have been revisiting the conversation started by Ben Brown a couple years ago regarding streamlining the login and identification process for users of low-security services. The use case Brown defines perfectly describes the kind of service I’m looking at providing, and though the trend doesn’t seem to have taken off (though Glenn Fleishman’s online portal for _The Magazine_ is one example), but I still find Brown’s description of both the user-facing and the developer-facing benefits.
- **[The Username Is a Relic. Here’s How to Fix It—Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/02/honan-billions/):** Along similar lines, last year Mat Honan discussed the decreasing viability of unique usernames as a form of identification for online services as the scale of userbases increasingly outstrips the availability of useful names. It seems silly to worry that my service will have the problem of having millions of users in the first days of development, but the design problem is interesting and could produce interesting problems to solve even if the practical requirement never proves necessary.
