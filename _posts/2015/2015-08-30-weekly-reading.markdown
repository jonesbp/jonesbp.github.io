- [**A Salute to Solo Programmers—Jean-Louis Gassée—Monday Note**](http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/08/24/a-salute-to-solo-programmers/): This, admittedly nostalgic, essay from Gassée struck a chord with me for the way it recreated the worldview around computers and programming that so attracted me in the 90s. I am fully aware of the power that the availability of large libraries and services gives me to make things that are far more superficially impressive than what I could make twenty years ago, but that approach also runs the risk of transforming the creativity of this work into one of configuring libraries and modules. I used to think that the creation of the product was what interested me and that I didn’t mind this transition. I’m becoming less certain of that.
- [**Digital Star Chamber—Frank Pasquale—Aeon Magazine**](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/judge-jury-and-executioner-the-unaccountable-algorithm/): The arguments here won’t be new to people familiar with Pasquale’s work, but I include it here for its concise formulation of an important subject that is rarely covered well in popular media.
