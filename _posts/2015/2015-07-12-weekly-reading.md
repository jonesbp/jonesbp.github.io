      Provides a good balance between big picture introduction to the design considerations ethnographic research can open up for a project and just enough nuts and bolts practical advice to point the reader in the direction of what to do next.

    note: >
      Seth Godin writes in the sort of breathless self-help style that I always have a difficult time slogging through, but there are always some insightful approaches to new ideas hanging around in the gung ho attitude. I’m glad to have read this while pulling together the initial pieces of a new project, but it was definitely the sort of reading that is more about creating a certain short-term frame of mind than in collecting new long-term insights to carry with me.

    note: >
      Having used Sass in practice for years, the introductory nature of most of this was familiar review. Having only learned by doing, however, it was nice to confirm I wasn’t missing any essential basic tools or features. That said, Cederholm’s techniques for using Sass with media queries are far beyond what I’ve been doing and I will start employing them immediately.

    note: >
      I read this the first time as we were starting [The Appendix](http://theappendix.net), and it was helpful in providing some shape to how we would approach our content-creation process. Now, with The Appendix mostly in the rear-view mirror and a new project on the way, re-reading it has provided a whole new set of insights into what to do right next time.

I spent the week catching up on reading and re-reading some stuff from the [A Book Apart](http://abookapart.com) before leaving my library behind in the States and moving to Europe for the year.
