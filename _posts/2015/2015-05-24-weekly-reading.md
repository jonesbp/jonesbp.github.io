    note: >
      Having learned database design and programming through self-study and essentially completely through trial-and-error, I’ve always been sensitive to the possibility that I’m missing some basics when I encounter a bit of database jargon I don’t understand. About to embark on a couple of projects on which naivete regarding database design could come and bite me later on. Ran through this introductory presentation pretty quickly; it was clearly written and basically platform-agnostic.

    note: >
      I continue to wish that there were more engagement with the consequences of the plague in the world rather than following the protagonists. The Australian navy’s primacy in submarine warfare because it had been the only navy with mixed male and female submarine crews is another great example of the payoffs of the world built here.

    note: >
      Glenny has a dry wit, even at times when dealing with some pretty bleak material. He sets out to explain the globalized generation of organized crime, framing his chronology between the collapse of the Soviet Union and China’s ascendance on the global stage. Fascinating details and anecdotes, but also a compelling argument for the role of the misguided international policing, trade, and military policies in incubating these criminal organizations.
  - id: debellis-citation-analysis
    note: >
      I’ve been thinking a lot about citations in history writing recently because of a new project. This history of the development of citation analysis techniques in the sciences was actually surprisingly engaging and readable. A great introduction to thinking some of the basic theoretical questions information scientists consider in working when analyzing citations and other (potential) markers of intellectual community.
