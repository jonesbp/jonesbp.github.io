- [**Notes from the field: Retracing Sixteenth-Century Steps in Seville—Not Even Past**](https://notevenpast.org/notes-from-the-field-retracing-steps-in-sixteenth-century-seville/): Mark Sheaves’s recollection of his walks around Sevilla mirror my own from my time researching the Archivo General de Indias there. It doesn’t that Mark and my projects’ share an interest in Monardes, that we had the same dissertation supervisor, and are dealing with much of the same secondary literature. These shared interests and experiences surely contribute to making Sevilla evocative for both of us. My experiences with historical serendipity walking in Sevilla, however, have encouraged me to walk more wherever I go, and frequently to walk aimlessly. Given my familiarity with its history, the sidewalks of Sevilla were thinker with these encounters than anywhere else has been, but Ghent, Copenhagen, and even Columbus, Ohio all have offered up similar experiences when given the chance.
- [**Toolkits for the Mind—MIT Technology Review**](http://www.technologyreview.com/review/536356/toolkits-for-the-mind): I often find myself trying to make the case to non-programmer friends that computer languages can have a culture and a perspective just as spoken languages do. Given the relatively limited cases and communities of use for programming languages versus spoken languages, I have no illusion that the effects are as large with programming languages, but they are nonetheless interesting. This argument, of course, is no unique insight of mine; it is essentially a truism; however, this essay does a great job of making the case based on clear real world narrative and limited theoretical elaboration.
