      Surprisingly uplifting and sweet in the end relative to Pollack‘s usual voice, the protagonist learns to appreciate his place in the world and to be satisfied with his life choices by virtue of countless repeats of his first four decades. Not so much time travel, these shifts are both involuntary and predictable, like a <i>Groundhog Day</i> that lasts forty years. Those familiar with Pollack‘s non-fiction work will recognize some (not always flattering) character traits in the protagonist in spite of the fact that Pollack appears as himself in at least one of life‘s playthroughs. That Pollack both writes himself into and distances himself from his character reflects my own experience of the novel. As a new father, the ultimately sweet and heartwarming conclusion landed with me, but the sardonic humor helped me keep my distance on the way there.
