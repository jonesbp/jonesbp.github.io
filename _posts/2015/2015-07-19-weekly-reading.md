- [**Website, Profiled: Why Are the Most Important People in Media Reading The Awl?—The Verge**](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/9/8908279/the-awl-profile-choire-sicha-john-herrman-matt-buchanan): This was a great profile at The Verge by Josh Dzieza, and I’m happy to see The Awl recognized in more mainstream media for the work that’s being done there. From a narrative standpoint, not much was new to me, but it’s still nice to have it all packaged in the same place. From my perspective in trying to get another publishing project started, there were some numbers here that I hadn’t seen other places and that was very informative. As an aside, Choire’s [episode](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-19-choire-sicha) of the Longform podcast was great.
- [**After Moore’s Law: How Phones Are Becoming Open-Source—WIRED**](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/08/features/moores-law/viewall): I’ve always been interested in the work Bunnie Huang was doing, and this piece that takes an electronics components shopping trip in Shenzen as an occasion to explore the leveling possibilities of the commoditization of processing power. I read _WIRED_ less and less these days, but there was something about this piece that made me feel like I could was reading old _WIRED_ if I squinted a bit. Perhaps it was just my sympathy for the author and the subject, but either way there is some interesting, hopeful prognosticating here.
