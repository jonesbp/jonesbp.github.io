I use Vim and command mode in any GUI editors that support it, so I’m hitting the Esc key hundreds of times a day. I’ve always been curious about mapping my Caps Lock key to escape to cut down on the distance I have to reach, but it used to require [quite a bit of complexity](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127591/using-caps-lock-as-esc-in-mac-os-x#8437594).

I recently moved to a new MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and a virtual Esc key, so I decided to look into it again.

As of macOS Sierra 10.12.1, it’s incredibly simple.

1. Open System Preferences
2. Go to the Keyboard pane and select the Keyboard tab
3. Click the Modifier Keys… button on the bottom right
4. From the popup menu to the right of “Caps Lock (⇪) Key”, select “⎋ Escape”
