      This is the first of the Adam Dalgliesh mysteries I’ve ever read, and I intend to read more. All of the comfortable and satisfying elements of a mystery novel are there, but James is a better writer and a keener social observer than most.

      Alexander’s novella is set in the cyberpunk universe of the Android: Netrunner collectible card game. Alexander is a good writer and has done interesting work as a critic of games and online communities and experiences, so I found this experiment with a sort of ‘sanctioned fan fiction’ intriguing. I probably needed to know more about the card game to get more out of it from that perspective, but the story itself is a timely exploration of the overlapping modern media and surveillance environments.

      Fun Marvel superhero stuff focusing on low-stakes, personal conflict with a great, bright color palette and light humorous voice.
