        The first of the Lord Wolsey mysteries I've readâ€”this one has him undercover as a copy writer to investigate a suspicious death at an advertising firm. There are clear Wodehousian influences in Sayers's treatment of her protagonist, and the mystery itself unfolded nicely. From a historical perspective the social commentary on advertising, recreational drug use, and consumerism was interesting.

        It can be easy to get into patterns of knee jerk rejection of these businesses, particularly Uber, with the stories in the news about the labor and housing problems caused by these business models. I think Stone is fundamentally more sympathetic to the goals of these two businesses than I am, but generally he provides an even-handed account that saves room for critique. I agree that these businesses are likely signals of a new economy, but I don't know hat I am quite as enthusiastic about that possibility as Stone is. It will be interesting to see what happens when these business models become sufficiently common that they don't require a connection to messianic founders to be viable.
