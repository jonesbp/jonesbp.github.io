> What is kind of amusing — and telling — is that as John McCarthy, who invented the name “Artificial Intelligence”, [noted](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/1/144824-artificial-intelligence-past-and-future/fulltext), the definition of specialized AI is changing all of the time. Specifically, once a task formerly thought to characterize artificial intelligence becomes routine — like the aforementioned chess-playing, or Go, or a myriad of other taken-for-granted computer abilities — we no longer call it artificial intelligence.
