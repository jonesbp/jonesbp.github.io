Last night I started a new side project for the first time in over a year. I installed Django, I initialized a Git repository, and I created an app.

For the last several months, I have been putting pressure on myself to study and learn some new skills. I have made some progress, but also find myself going for long periods without working with these materials.

The feeling of having a project, for me, makes things different. I have a bucket to put this learning into and a scaffolding on which to try out some of these ideas. I have somewhere to go and do something when I find myself with a free 30 minutes.

Iâ€™m excited to feel this way again.
