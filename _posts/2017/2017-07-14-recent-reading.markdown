      Relatively cruft-free as far as self-help/parenting books go, provides both some useful framing for approaching decisions around just how much one wants to do to run a household and discrete practical ‘tips and tricks’ for pursuing it. The “minimalist” framing frequently feels shoehorned into sections to maintain a consistent language to match the marketing-friendly title, but not to the extent of distracting from the book’s usefulness.

      This is the first installment in a series of [cozy mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_mystery) about a ceramics shop owner in Albuquerque who stumbles through a series of mix-ups involving murder and contraband artifacts. The author has a political hobby horse with regards to cultural heritage policy that results in some unpleasant monologues from the protagonist from time to time, but the Albuquerque setting and light mood make it enjoyable reading. There are some first book jitters here in the writing and plotting that fortunately shake out in the second one.

      The second installment in this cozy mystery series set in Albuquerque cleans up some of the first book rough edges from _The Pot Thief Who Studied Pythagoras_. This one develops the appealing Albuquerque setting a bit more and presents some humorous caricature of academia.

      The organizing principle of this collection of interviews and essays is to encourage historians to consider the epistemological consequences of GIS as tool of inquiry and an exploratory methodology, rather than as a piece of the production process useful only for creating static maps as ‘end products’. The Gunnar Olsson and David Staley interviews and von Lünen’s concluding essay were of particular interest in helping to consider the boundaries of what geographical inquiry (and GIS in particular) can do to expand the questions available to historians.

    note: >
      This short book presents a synthesis of academic research on crowdsourcing across a variety of academic disciplines including computer science, business, and the social sciences. It provides a useful working definition of what constitutes ‘crowdsourcing’ (and what it is not) and runs through both positive indications for its future as a tool in a variety of fields and ethical and political problems it presents that must be addressed. A quick read and useful for shaping design considerations for possible online projects that would include collaborative peer contributions (though, per the reading, not necessarily ‘crowdsourcing’).
