      Duncan Clark is a former analyst with Morgan Stanley, and his background is readily apparent for better and worse in his approach to this book. His personal experience in the early days of the Internet business in China, including with Alibaba itself, means he has keen insights into the formation of Alibaba that is frequently elided with cliché and comparisons to Amazon in other accounts. However, the granularity of detail and lack of synthesis can make the account drag from time-to-time, particularly in the middle to late stages.  I’m glad I’ve read this, but would also be interested in a more analytical account.

      The organizing principal of this Moosewood cookbook was to collect the recipes that for which employees hear the most requests from patrons which makes it a good single stop for those not ready to work through the dozen or so other books they’ve put out. Published in 2013, it is a fortieth anniversary commemoration of sorts for the restaurant and includes some nice front-matter on the history of the restaurant, its role in promoting vegetarian diets and healthful eating, and how the food industry has changed in the United States in the last 40 years.

      This one from Gibson strikes me as all setting and world-building around a pretty tight, but shallow, thriller plot. There is only limited exploration of the sociological and technological consequences of the world he builds relative to some of his other work, but lots of interesting bits to pick out of the setting nonetheless.
