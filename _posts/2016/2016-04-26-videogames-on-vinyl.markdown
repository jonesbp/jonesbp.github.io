One of the record label trends I’ve had fun watching recently is the profusion of videogame soundtracks on vinyl. I’m a sucker for physical manifestations of ‘virtual’ phenomena.

_Not on the list:_ I recently bought the 5 year anniversary colored vinyl edition of Jim Guthrie’s [Sword &amp; Sworcery LP: The Ballad of the Space Babies](https://jimguthrie.bandcamp.com/album/sword-sworcery-lp-the-ballad-of-the-space-babies) which is now sold out on vinyl, but still available on CD and to download.
