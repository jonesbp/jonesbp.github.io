      Sometimes lightly ironic, sometimes sardonic, this novel loosely based on the life of August Engelhardt and his failed utopia in German New Guinea is an entertaining satire of early 20th century European, and particularly German, enthusiasms for empire and esoterica.
  - id: kress-the-fall
    note: >
      A quick, tight novella that weaves three separate timelines in a post-apocalyptic climate change parable.
  - id: barnes-justification

      I’ve been experimenting with Kindle-only self-published and small press genre fiction out of curiosity. The writing here is not the strongest, but things moved forward quickly enough that I stuck with it. I was waiting for the Silicon Valley setting to pay off more than it did.

      I’ve been on a bit of a hiatus from work-related history reading and have been trying to pick up some readable classics to stay at least minimally engaged. Both a biography of a Ricci and a multi-themed global history connecting Counter-Reformation Europe and China, it’s a beautiful book and one that I will return to with a more critical eye once I get back into proper work.

      This account by a retired Delaware US Attorney of uncovering, luring, and apprehending the Chinese operator of a cracked software service provides an interesting window into the US law enforcement response to software piracy. Unfortunately, the details of how things worked on the other side of the coin are relatively limited and obscured by the author’s tough-guy style. I was expecting analysis of the mechanics of a contraband software operation and got an autohagiography.

The move back to the States and a recent house purchase and move have killed all of my reading aside from the lightest leisure reading. Here’s a clearing of the decks from the last couple of months with the hopes that I’ll be picking up new titles at a slightly quicker rate soon…
