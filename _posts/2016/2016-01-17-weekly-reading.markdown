- [**The Radical Promise of the Rustbelt—Cyborgology—David Banks**](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2016/01/11/the-radical-promise-of-the-rustbelt/): David Banks’s identification of the radical potential for Rust Belt cities given their size and physical footprints relative to their proximity to rural hinterland distills something that I have struggled to put my finger on about the way central Columbus works—finding products from local producers feels a little bit more like an efficient mode of consumption than a yuppie hobby there than it often did in Austin. Coincidentally, Banks’s comparison of the Rust Belt with the Sun Belt helps to set the frame of why I’ve never really trusted this intuition about Columbus. Columbus itself is not really a ‘Rust Belt’ city except in very, very small pockets of the center city; the vast majority of Columbus works like a Sun Belt city. It is, however, a countercultural destination for young people from the surrounding areas, many of whom did grow up in Rust Belt cities like Youngstown, Toledo, or Cleveland. So the quite a bit of the small business, creative, and cultural activity in central Columbus looks like the ‘Rust Belt Renaissance’, but the car-focused, air-conditioned-insurance-office-economy surroundings create a feeling of falseness. Having read this, I’m not sure if I now have a better grasp of that falseness, or if I’ve been shown my error in considering it to be false in the first place.
