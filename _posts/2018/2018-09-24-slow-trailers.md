I just came across these [”slow trailers”](http://relax.thegardensbetween.com) for The Gardens Between today. They are three 10-15 minutes-long animated short films with ambient scores by [Tim Shiel](https://timshiel.bandcamp.com/).

I’ve found them to be compelling and soothing viewing, and I love the idea of them as promotional items. They upend the expected rhythms of online video consumption in a way that seems to pre-figure some of what players of the game can expect.
