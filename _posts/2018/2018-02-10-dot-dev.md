title: Forced HTTPS in Chrome on Local .dev Domains
excerpt: "A reminder about why my old .dev domains insist on loading via HTTPS"

I used to use .dev as a domain extension for doing local development using [MAMP Pro](http://mamp.info), but 
I have had to switch to using .local instead because Safari and Chrome both now force any 
domain ending in .dev to load over HTTPS which I’m not running for my local development 
environments.

Google made this decision (and Apple is following their lead) because Google bought the 
rights to provide .dev as a publicly available TLD and will be putting them on sale in 
May of this year. For now the browser-side enforcement of the HTTPS-only policy is 
inconvenient, but it means making a change that I would need to make regardless to avoid 
potential collisions in the future.

This is a new enough situation that I still have old projects for which I haven’t changed the 
settings. When I try to load them, I get the message that the server is unavailable even though 
I’m looking at MAMP Pro chugging away right in front of me. This happens sufficiently infrequently 
that it still takes me about five or ten minutes of confusion to remember the cause and 
change over to a .local domain.

As usual, the hope is that writing up a short note will mean I remember what’s going on 
next time.
