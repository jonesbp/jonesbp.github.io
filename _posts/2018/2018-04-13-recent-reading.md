      I really enjoyed this. It’s organized around three parts: a short history of shared interests between scientists and the artistic avant-garde, particularly in the early twentieth century; a catalog of recent and contemporary artists organized according to the scientific disciplines from which thy take material, techniques, and inspiration; and a short theoretical discussion of what these connections may mean for the practice of both art and science in the near future.

      George uses a trip she takes as a supernumerary on a container ship from the UK to Southeast Asia via the Suez Canal as occasion to explore various angles of the maritime shipping industry: labor, corruption, environmental and economic consequences, etc. It’s all interesting, and the travelogue elements of her own experience on the ship and the lives of the sailors she gets to know are particularly engaging.

      This was an enjoyable espionage thriller told from the perspectives of two old Oxford friends who end up on either side of the Munich Conference. I’ve read another one of Harris’s novels and appreciate his sensitivity to historical detail. It’s reminiscent of Le Carré novels where the spycraft and suspense all feel very human-scale.

      Not surprisingly coming from Ellis, this is a rather sardonic and brutal Bond story even though The Bond character himself is pretty light. It’s a good balance that triangulated a few of the movie Bond types and still feels true to the novels. The recognizable Berlin landscape details in the artwork were fun.
