Every once in a while I’ll stumble on a collection of things that articulates a sensibility (my sensibility?) so comprehensively and surprisingly that I have to know more.

I recently got a notice that [C418][c418]–the German producer of the soundtrack for the videogame Minecraft—was releasing a new album. I own the [Minecraft soundtrack on vinyl][minecraft-vinyl] because I like the music, but also because I got a kick out of the [trend][videogame-vinyl] for painstakingly packaged physical releases of these born-digital compositions that got under way a few years ago. I would have let this one pass me by because I just bought several new records a few days ago, but I saw the [@ghostramp][ghostramp] account post about it on Twitter mentioning a label I’d never heard of, so I followed up.

It’s on a label I’d never heard of: [Driftless Recordings][driftless].[^name] I was expecting more videogame music. There is none. I scrolled down the list of records not recognizing anything, and then saw that they had a [Hayden Pedigo][pedigo] record as an early release. And an ambient compilation produced for Moogfest. Videogame music composers and 12-string guitar instrumentals on the same label? I am intrigued.

And then there is this righteous album artwork by [Brian Blomerth][blomerth]:

for a band called North Americans I have also never heard of.[^mcdermott] So I watch the video I had initially scrolled past.

And it is so great. More guitar instrumentals. More ambience. Whistling. Julianna Barwick plays synth elsewhere on the record according to the review in [Tiny Mix Tapes][tinymixtapes]. It’s a cascade of more things I’m into that I previously didn’t know.

I get bummed out about algorithmic smoothing of taste and aesthetics, particularly online. I get bummed out about the way that online forms box in the expression of identity by forcing the self to be shared in a way that fits the data expectations of a particular platform or piece of software. And then, every once in a while, the Internet still throws up something that doesn’t make much sense as anything other than itself. This collection of stuff was that for me yesterday, and it was a blast.

When you buy stuff on their store, you can throw in a mystery record for another $5. I did. Can it be possible I won’t be into it?

[^name]: It’s a good name.
[^mcdermott]: Turns out it’s not a band, but the recording name of Patrick McDermott, one of the label co-founders.
