> I do see art as experimentation. It’s fundamentally he process of combining things that have never been combined before. I’m fascinated by the process of translating ideas from one reality into another and ways that systems and structures can influence and guide new creation. To some extent art is an excuse. It’s a word that we use for yet-to-be-defined progress—necessary experiments in thought space which help us define and test limits. These are experiments that allow us to question, reflect, discover, and appreciate.
