I’ve set up a new small web page I’m calling [Oddments](https://oddments.brianjon.es) to collect links to and information about projects I’m working on.

I’m hoping that having a place to collect these things will provide some motivation to keep building them.

I keep bouncing back and forth on the value of having hobbies and pursuits that generate ephemeral products. On the one hand it is the case that the pressure to conceive of any freetime pursuit as something to be connected to a larger project or to be productized or otherwise commodified is a powerful trap. On the other, my life at the moment makes for such infrequent moments of freedom to play that having leisure pursuits that produce lasting products is a nice reminder that I do in fact have hobbies. 

So here is [Oddments](https://oddments.brianjone.s). Let’s hope it keeps growing.
