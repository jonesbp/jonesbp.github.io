I’ve recently been connecting to a DigitalOcean droplet with the mosh shell using the [Blink](https://www.blink.sh) app on my iPad. It’s been a fun way to do some light web development work away from my desk at home without having to lug a lot of gear.

I’m using Apple’s smart folio keyboard for the time-being. It does not have an `Esc` key.

I’ve gotten around a lot of my `Esc` key muscle memory already (I end up in all caps by accident a lot because `Esc` is mapped to `Caps Lock` on my Mac), but I found myself in vim on the server this morning and realized I had no idea how to leave insert mode without an `Esc` key.

Turns out `Ctrl` + `[` sends the same ASCII code that `Esc` does. Now I know.
